Therefore, I believe that Prof. Beeson has done the best he could. I don't know why people keep complaining about partial credit, but I agree with his point of view - If you want to become an engineer, you are not allowed to make mistakes. That's life, deal with it.", 'Prof. Beeson is extremely apathetic to students, he does not care if you pass or fail. On exams, he does not give any partial credit, which is extremely odd for a math class.

Strongly do not recommend him', 'I sleep in class and I still manage to average a B grade for the 3 midterms.', "He's so boring and even makes me feel sleepy. I always plays computer games during classes and have to learn the knowledge by myself", "2 midterms, 1 final. 10 questions total, and doesn't give partial credit or any extra credit. His voice is very monotone, making it difficult to pay attention. What's worse is trying to understand his handwriting. Half the time, I couldn't read what he wrote because it was so tiny and pretty much chicken scratch. Try to avoid taking him.", 'Decent professor, knows his material really well but isnt effective in teaching it to other... tests and exams arent too bad they are similar to the sample exams he gives... similar concepts just different problems... quizzes time to time... be prepared to learn the majority of the lectures on your own...', 'DO NOT take this professor, terrible at speaking and explaining. Tests are only a few questions and a lot of points. Gave one section an easier final than the other, and does not give partial credit.', "I took calculus before so the class wasn't as hard however, his tests are only 10 problems usually and each is worth a ton and he doesn't give partial credit usually so you have to exact. No calculators for his class and random quizzes in class from time to time.

Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class.', 'Beeson is one the first professors that I had at SJSU. He lives and breathes the CLRS book. His lectures are very clear, but the projects, which account for 50% of the grade are difficult, so work on them early. Tests were easy and open book. Come to lecture and take notes!', "He analyzes everything you say like a bad shrink. The other commenter wasn't kidding when they said he stops for minutes at a time to contemplate the next step. Heard of planning? No calculators, which would be fine except that some test questions are ridiculous without one (eg. plug 5/4 into 4x^3+15x^2+12x+6. Actual step in a final exam Q)", "Because he spent several years creating his math software, he believes it's the ultimate teacher when teaching calculus.  He's apathetic to students, expects so much from them. Very unclear, boring.

Know how to teach student. know how to separate the section and assignment, then student could learn step by step. Not push too much. You need to read the book before listen the lecture. Learn a lot from the course. Very useful course overall.', 'Very hard homework but easy tests.  If you listen to the lectures and attend class you will do great, reading the book is mostly optional.', "He's a damn good professor but he can be a bit of a jerk sometimes.  I was in the section where he yelled at the whole class for 30 minutes because half of the people in both sections failed the 2nd midterm.  Just keep up with the lecture notes, study before midterms, and do all the HW.  You should do just fine.", "Beeson is one of the best teachers I've had at this school.  It's a hard class, but he explains things well. I've never met a teacher that was as willing to help students as this guy.  He'll take a later bus home to santa cruz if people still need help!  Don't take this class with any other teacher. Trust me.", 'Beeson is a hardass when it comes to grading but if you prepare for his class every day you will benefit. He  cares about you coming to class and doing all the daily problems, you will come out of this class ready to produce industry level code. He seems to care deeply about the quality of engineers sjsu pumps out, that is you, better study!', "He's a little nuts but he's very smart and is really interested in the subject of CS146.  I'd strongly recommend him for that class.", "If you want to flunk, take his class. He assumes you can learn on your own, write your own code without his lecture or explanation.

Seriously though, make sure you READ THE ENTIRE GREET SHEET.', "You have to stay engaged in this class throughout the semester to do well.

You have to read lectures at home and do them on your own time. This was changed as of fall 2008. Very confusing instructions and professor not very helpful at all. AVOID him! You're better off learn on your own, he does not teach.", "He is a terrific teacher.  Read the assigned text before coming to class or you will be lost in the lecture.

As per grading, you get what you earn!', 'This class is easy as long as you attend lecture and write the code prior or afterwards.  Lab is mandatory and consists of EXACTLY what you cover in lecture.  He goes slightly off from his notes online which is why lecture is important to attend.

BUT his exam is always including  new material that he didn't teach in class which could kill your grade. It's like Hey class I got Surprise for you!!!.

Few friends who good at programming didn't do too well so Im speaking for everyone.

A) He doesn't know Java very well. B) if you miss even ONE assignment during the semester, you get an F in the class.

Also randomly assigned more work, flunk you if you don't do it, but not give points if you do", "This class is the most fun of all the CS classes. The hw's are fun and he gives you a lot of hints.

(it helps if you read the notes before the class, then it's much easier to get/remember the content)", "Class is very easy. His notes are online, so you never need to go to class and the lab is just about following directions and looking up class notes. Grading is easy and only based on programming, no major tests. He teaches by code, not through a book. It's an easy A+, but then again, it's C#. You right click and program practically writes itself.", "This teacher is just awesome!!! Very well prepared lectures and clear samples. Not afraid to give an A. Do all the homework, run the samples, and you are set. I think the course is very good for future cs programmers who 'do' want to program.", "taking his class is a waste of time.  i could learn windows programming on my own.  his final is stupid, he doesn't even other looking at the code you write.", "Pretty horrible professor with time management issues. Spends a good portion of each lecture talking about nothing, and ends up going over in time because he didn't finish the lecture. Class is really easy. You don't need to go to class, just practice the online notes. Can't really teach but tries.", "Don't get excited if you get A's by beggining of the course. By 3 quarter of semester you most likely to get B's, & C on final! In the beginning you know exactly what you doing, however, at the end you have no clue! The guy says to cut'n'paste code from his website & don't bother understanding it!", 'The beginning of the course is fun, since the prof. goes into a lot of details. However, he wastes a lot of time talking about irrelevant stuff and ends up catching up at the nd of the course. Too much stuff left unexplaned, but asked on the finals! You have to surf the web to find many answers!!!', "He's an alright teacher, you don't really have to go to the lectures, just read the notes and try the stuff for yourself to make sure you get it. I went to his office hours a couple times, pretty helpful; and you can't argue with XP Pro for 7 bucks.", "Hella easy class. Most people end up getting A's. You don't even have to go to class. All his lecture notes are posted online. His lectures are boring anyway. Make sure you do the practice midterms before you go into the real ones.", "He's a decent guy, although you have to sit through a lot of pure talk and not even take any notes. Labs and hw are what count, and it's easy to follow if you follow his online notes. I recommend him.", "Arrogant!!!!!!!!!!!!  He will mention his stupid MathXPert program at least a hundred times.  He enjoys reprimanding his students.  Very difficult to communicate with.  Don't take this jack@$$!", "One of the more arrogant teachers in the CS department. Don't bother going to his office hours unless you are first in line.  He usually spends all his time helping 1 student. The material is good but when you ask him for help he is difficult. Study notes", 'His online lecture notes make up the textbook and they are really helpful.  He walks you through the homeworks.  Everything is channeled through his web site so you never have to worry about missing things if you miss class. Labs are easier then they look', 'Great guy. Pretty easy class.

Consider other options if possible', "She has a strong accent, so it's hard to catch what she's saying sometimes. Lectures are just her reading straight from the slides, so honestly, it's easier to just check the slides she posts on Canvas later. If you're really trying to learn Java, this probably isn't the best way. I ended up watching YouTube tutorials to make sense of the material.", "The positive feedback here seems to focus only on her lenient grading and skipping the final exam. However, she cant  teach effectively fundamental topics, making it feel like you have to learn all by yourself without a teacher. Consider other options if they're available.", 'She generously offered extra credit opportunities and reviewed solutions during class.  I highly recommend attending her class regularly. The final project may be challenging, but she provides valuable feedback and allows for resubmission.  The class is quite manageable.', "I took Yan Chen's 166 this semester and thought it was great. +-30% extra credit from optional HW, +3% EC if you get >50% on midterms, and you can substitute your final grade with the sum of your midterm scores and EC on top. She cares about her students and makes the class accessible and fun. I recommend doing lots of EC; little time on exams.", "175 is fairly straightforward. The class is structured to teach things, mostly through exercises and projects. It is up to you however to decide what you learn and don't learn from the class, if you use it for the term project or not.

Do all the extra credit (especially the project) and you should be very fine, even if you bomb the final.', "Terrible lecturer. Talks fast with heavy accent and doesn't give time to digest what she rambles about, let alone take notes. She records, but if you go in person she goes over solutions to assignments. You can choose to skip final if you do the project(very difficult). Easy if you just want to pass. If you actually want to learn, take Ahmad.", "Don't know why rating is so low, She gives lots of extra credit and wants you to pass. Accent is bit hard to understand at first, but lecture slides are enough to study and pass. Attendance is not mandatory but if you attend exercise qs are discussed which are useful. As long as you are doing weekly work, passing this class is easy.", 'Genuinely have no clue why her ratings are so low. Chen is a great lecturer and her slides are clear.

The group project is very digestible when broken into parts.', 'Try get more EC, and do the project even if it is optional. This class is not that hard. Be prepared to read.', 'Despite what other people may say about Professor Yan Chen, in my experience I thought she was a wonderful professor. Although her grading may seem harsh being that most of the grade is based on your final score, her lectures are very insightful and help a lot on material covered in exams. She is also very passionate about the topic as well.', "No idea why her reviews are so terrible. She's a decent professor and her class structure makes it nigh-impossible to fail. Her classes typically have a very high average final grade. Course gets harder over time but you'll have the option to add a percentage of your project score/HW score to your final. If you just try, you will end up with a B/A.", 'Gives up to 30 pts of extra credit if you do all the optional assignments. Her lectures are straightforward, but she goes fast. She also records lectures and goes over the assignments in detail every class which is nice. Responds to emails quickly. Final used questions that were extremely similar to the optional assignments.', "She's a bit hard to understand, but honestly I kind of enjoyed the class format. She posts all lectures and slides online, and your only homework is a weekly Canvas quiz. The grading is entirely final based, and your homework contributes as EC with an optional project to boost/replace grade. Completely manageable class, iffy prof.", "She has a heavy accent and could barely hear it. She reads everything off the slides in her lectures, so don't bother to go to the lectures, just read the slides she posts in Canvas later that day. If learning Java was your goal, this might not be it. Decided to watch YouTube tutorials about the lectures to understand them better.", 'The weekly quizzes ramp up in difficulty exponentially, which super annoying. When she goes over the problems for the weekly quizzes she just does it and disregards that 90% of the class felt like unaliving themselves due to the difficulty of the problem.

Her lecture is really organized and she tried her best to explain the problems.", "Yan Chen is a great professor, but she speaks too fast, also if u take notes, don't even bother, you will miss important information.

Take advantages for every possible EC/Assignments/Quizzes...and try your best to attend each lectures as they are helpful. Group project is not easy, but it's optional. Follow the course progress, then everything is manageable - even get a good grade. Prof. is willint to help you improve grade if needed.", 'I got an A in Summer 2023. I learned a lot from her. I agree that the final is 100pts which is the overall grade. But she offers 30pts of EC, 70pts for the project; both are optional. I took the final instead. It was way easier than the project. Some questions are exact or similar to the quizzes. To get an A, please do the 30pts EC with the final.', 'Absolutely excellent class, does not deserve such a low rating. Solid curriculum, class is quite interesting, and offers an online option for those who do not want to come to class in person. Final is the entire class (100%), but the class offers around 60% of extra credit in the form of normal assignments and projects.', "Honestly not sure why Yan Chen has such a low average. Imo, she's a top g. Once you understand her grading, you can take real advantage and not even take the final. My only criticism is that she can speak quite fast at times. Highly recommend!", "Not sure why people are saying she cant teach regarding CS154, I feel like I learned more from her compared to Ahmad who has a higher rating. (I'm retaking with her). She could go a bit fast, but she's organized and is accessible.", "I am surprised the rating is so low. To me, she is ok. She puts lots of effort in lectures and homework, and responds email quickly. Sometimes she can't explain topics in depth though.", "I don't think a 2/5 is warranted, I've taken way worse profs with higher RMP scores. Easy class, if you put in the work you can learn. Lots of extra credit; grading system is confusing, but if you do all the assignments you can skip the final exam to get an A.", 'The only positive reviews here refer to her easy grading and not taking the final.

Another concern is his alleged targeting of students, with reports circulating about instances where he has disrespected and raised his voice at multiple individuals over trivial matters.", 'My experience with this guy was overshadowed by their reluctance to provide constructive feedback on assignments. Despite my efforts to improve, the minimal guidance offered left me feeling uncertain about my academic progress and undermined my motivation to excel in the course.', 'Professor Yazdankhah exhibited a lack of responsiveness to emails and inquiries, making it challenging to get timely answers to important questions. This lack of communication hindered my ability to grasp certain concepts, and it was frustrating to feel overlooked as a student seeking guidance.', 'I recently had a disappointing experience with Professor Ahmad.

Not only an EXCELLENT prof, but also cares about his studs. Puts great effort on his lectures and even tho the courses are challenging by nature, he finds a way to make each topic super clear. I am graduating this sem and  prof Y has been my fave by far and the only prof I will miss.', "Ahmad is the GOAT, he's my absolute favorite CS professor because he teaches 151 (object oriented programming) so well yet is so caring about his students.

I would take him again for another class.", 'The GOAT. Weekly quizzes, really in-depth lectures, no textbook (have to watch video before class, discuss in class), midterm and final were not bad, 1 group project at end.

He has many interesting anecdotes and is always open to questions. Thank you professor!", "One of the kindest and most understanding professors I've ever had.

He was flexible on the dates for the exams, assignments were straight-forward, lectures were funny and informative. Loved it.', 'This was my only class with this professor but I learned a lot and nothing in the class felt like a waste of time. There is a decent bit of homework with a program each week for every cipher system but tools are provided to make it as streamlined as possible. I very much enjoyed the course and would gladly take it again.', "Honestly one of the best CS classes I've taken here. Posts videos before class and reviews them during in-person lecture.

Take him if you can.", "Good choice! Posts lecture videos beforehand (1 hr long), so you don't need to go to class. Really wants us to ask him questions if we're confused. Exams & quizzes are closed-notes and time-crunched (1 min per question). Group project isn't too bad.

He also provides videos that are helpful to reference. Quizzes and exams are also straightforward from the lectures. He's also very open to answering questions students have for him.", 'Quizzes and exams are completely based on the slides. In his lecture videos, he makes everything crystal clear. In class, he goes over any questions students may have (students rarely has questions because videos are super clear so we usually dismiss class early). Highly recommend!', 'Kind of a strange teacher, but his lectures are amazing! No textbook- the class is based off his slides (which are great). Quizzes and tests are based off slides and lecture. There is 1 semester-long group project. He expects you to show up to every class, and will end class early if he finishes early. Would definitely recommend this Prof.!', "Professor Yazdankhah is absolutely hilarious. I wish the quizzes were at least slightly more difficult because they only really tested basic knowledge you'd get from skimming slides so it made me a bit lazy when studying, but to each their own. The class is not difficult and Professor Yazdankhah teaches clearly and succinctly.", "Just take him period, absolutely A M A Z I N G!

I also heard he's one of the easiest 151 professors compared to others.", 'Group project, guides you through each phase.

His lectures are the ones that dont give you stress bc theyre so smooth and well-explained! Take him!', 'Best CS professor at SJSU hands down! Lectures are CRYSTAL CLEAR bc he spends hours editing them. Work load is very reasonable and reflects lecture. All quiz and exams are pulled directly from lecture.

Overall, this class wasn't easy, but Professor Ahmad is great!", 'He has a good personality and he is high in IQ and EQ. He is easy to talk with and his lectures are great. Maybe I felt this class was too easy to study so I did not spend much time on it. As a result, I did badly on the tests. His tests are crazy. The time is not enough to finish all the questions unless you are really familiar I guess.', 'My view of this class may be different from urs bcuz it went online due to Covid 19 (had access to class recordings). Hes good at teaching. But boy, the exams have so many questions for the time given. Making a diagram takes longer online. U use JFLAP, take a screenie, upload to canvas files, embed it. Noticed a mistake on the pic? Repeat that. Ugh', 'Didnt give a crap about anyones issues transitioning to online during this covid situation. 15% of class wasnt able to finish 2nd midterm and final because of new requirements but still giving the same amount of time as in person exam. Doesnt hold office hours or answer questions. Says post discussion. Overall smartass.', "This course (formal languages) was surprisingly fun given the subject material. Prof. Yazdankhah is an excellent lecturer, and enjoys engaging with students in the class room. You will need to be on your toes in this course, as he tends to add trick questions on the weekly quizes, but as long as you pay attention you'll get an A. Good Professor.", "I'm not gonna lie the class is not easy. No coding in this class, basically we learn about computer machines early in CS history. The material can be hard sometimes, and the class needs stable studying time to follow up every week. The term project is extremely time-consuming and hard. The teacher's funny and friendly. Reachable and helpful.", "1 Quiz every Thursday, lecture gets boring and easy to be sidetracked, but without attending it can get confusing near the end of the course. Attendance not graded.

One of the best courses i've taken and it's because of him. You will not regret taking this class. Make sure to go to every class.", "He is a really great guy. Absolutely understanding and does his best to make the dry subject engaging. Really wants students to succeed. He brings chocolate and Madeline cookies so that's a bonus.

You will find his lectures never boring because he has such a strong sense of humor that he could turn everything mundane into jokes that I would want to laugh about!', "So easy, great professor, very friendly and very funny. Take him for 154, I can't imagine him teaching another class.", 'Ahmad is the best professor I have ever had.

Taking his class was the best', 'Best Professor ever!! He loves teaching and helping students. I wish all teachers were like him. This is the only class I feel like going in because professor is so caring and enthusiastic for teaching. Highly recommended. I wish he teaches more classes so I can actually learn something.', 'He LOVES THIS CLASS and you will too if you pay attention. Quiz questions are tricky at first but are weekly and cumulative with repeated questions so you get the hang of it quickly, and you will learn the material thoroughly. His slides make it very clear what you need to know, and his lecturing is entertaining and informative. A+ teacher', 'I liked his class. Would take him again.', "He definitely the best teacher I have had so far at this University. He cares more about you growing as a Computer Scientist than you passing the class. Now don't get me wrong he wants you to pass. Going to class is recommended. His lectures are very clear. Quizzes every week. I love this guy.", "This teacher has weekly quizzes. Most of them are repeats from previous quizzes, with a couple of new from the new material. His classes are interactive and he makes even the most abstract class into a practical class with tangible examples. If you're participating and show him you're using you're head during class you might even get a chocolate ;)", "Ahmad is a great professor. I've taken him for both CS 151 and CS 154, and I've loved his class both times. He gives minimal homework, but gives a fairly easy quiz each week for easy points and memorization, which helps a lot on his tests.   Ahmad is generally just a fun guy, and he's probably my favorite professor at SJSU. Would take again.", 'Lectures slides are easy to understand. He is a fun teacher who rewards student participation in class with chocolate! Weekly quizzes are easy because they are based on his slides and mostly multiple choice. Overall, easy grader, intuitive slides, and easy to get an A while learning key points b/c he repeats quiz questions so it sticks in your head', "A pretty easy class. Weekly quizzes, where you memorize some stuff off of lecture powerpoints that he posts up online. It's all conceptual stuff. He can be somewhat disorganized and his test questions/instructions are ambiguous at times . His lectures are interesting enough to keep me awake. Group project is worth a pretty big chunk of grade.", "This class is a very easy going and clear class. He gives weekly quizzes and honestly even though it sounds brutal, it is very beneficial in the long run. I didn't have to study longer than 30 minutes for the final exams and midterms. Homework was straightforward. Group project wasn't bad either. Lecture slides are straightforward & no book require", 'The thing that requires the most work for his class is the group project.

He was a pretty funny guy, get on his good side. Oh yeah and he gives out chocolate sometimes :D', "Professor Yazdankhah was a good professor, and I'm glad I took CS146 with him. Lectures were very clear. Assignments were challenging, and sometimes vague, but far from impossible. Most of the time the pseudocode was right in the textbook! His on-paper assignments were easy. The final wasn't bad - half of it was open-book! 1010 would take again.", 'Tests are tough. Group projects make up a lot of your grade. Grading criteria isn\'t very clear.

Simply put, don't take it with him.", 'terrible professor, he always assume you know everything from the beginning to the end of the chapters without discussing or talking about it in the class, and once he puts a random assignment out of no where on canvas , you would have no idea how to approach it :(', "He is not really well-prepared for the class. No homework or assignments whatsoever. When he gave out one, it's extremely complicated.   Always assume that students knew what he's talking about already. So what's the point of going to class then?  Occasional grammar mistakes in lecture slides.  I would recommend NOT taking him.", 'Nice guy. Decent teacher.

He always wants his student to learn something and do well not only during class but also after class (interview, job, etc.) His homework is hard, but you will gain tons of knowledge out of it. If you want a good grade, you need to earn it. Nothing is free!", "Oh my gosh, Ben is AMAZING! He's such a phenomenal lecturer, incredibly passionate, super engaging and energetic. He kept me awake when other teaches couldn't. It's clear OS's are his passion and he genuinely wants you to succeed. Even though the material was challenging, Ben always provided us with more than enough resources to succeed. 12/10!", "Super passionate about teaching OS. Replaces lowest exam with final and opportunities for extra credit. Office hours EVERY weekday. Highly receptive to class feedback/suggestions. Lots of readings, self-studying/experimentation. Hard class, but you'll learn a lot about OS, programming, industry, and life! One of the best CS professors at SJSU.", 'Very nice professor that wants you to succeed and ties things to real life application. Very helpful during office hours. The hard part about his class is he wants you to do a lot of the learning by experimenting outside of class. The class is definitely doable but takes a lot of time and self-learning but is fairly applicable in real life.', 'He does not deserve all the negativity I see here. You learn a lot of stuff in his class. Yes, the programming assignments are difficult, but if you go to class they are doable. Also, if you get stuck, he is very helpful in office hours. I think most people giving negative reviews might just be mad about doing poorly. I would take his course again.', 'Professor Reed is a great person. He is always there to support you during his office hours. On the other hand, the class itself is another story. The programming assignments are definitely something you may have never seen before, and the unassigned homework should be graded to help motivate students to perform better in class.', 'hardest professor ever. took this class as i thought other professor kong lee was hard. but this is even harder. very hard assignments (can hardly be completed). midterm very hard. most of class failed midterm. many students even dropped. he doesnt know how to teach. just laughs in whole class.', "Ben is extremely helpful if you go to his office hour. The class content is hard but you're gonna learn real useful stuff about operating systems.", 'I as well thought Ben would be a good professor; however, this class has made me regret. Ben is a very knowledgeable and nice person; however, he does not have the ability to TEACH it to students. The programming assignments are 100% on your own. No slides to study off of, and he speaks to us in a technical manner as if we already understand.', "I thought this professor would be a good choice in the beginning because he's new. Was looking forward to his class, but after taking his class for 2 weeks, I realize his HW and tests are insane. His test are hard and nothing related to his lecture. You're really going to need to study on your own completely if you take this class. Good luck!", 'Professor Reed is very passionate and talks about things that are relevant in todays tech field. He is happy to help and wants you to suceed. On the flip side his assignments are extremely individual research dependent and even with his provided tools the instructions make the project much more obscure.', 'Ben is new but totally rocked it this semester. He is passionate about what he does and since he is fresh out of industry he has a very good idea of what students need to know before they graduate and makes sure you do. The course content is not difficult as long as you participate in lecture. Definitely go to office hours, they help A LOT.', 'Ben is a really relaxed professor. His class is mostly lecture, for a lot of information is rote memorization. It is expected though. The coding assignments were really fun to do, they include utilities and libraries that were good to know. Only thing is that lectures are just retelling of the textbook. But the textbook is excellent, easy to read.', 'Ben is a nice professor with a lot of experience in the industry. His assignments are sorted and very interesting. With the extra credit, he can be an easy A. The downside is you can get lost at times in his lecture. However, he asks questions during lectures so that helps. He has lots of office hrs as well.'], 'Evan Merz': ['Very clear lectures. Overall great Prof.', "If you belong in CS you should have no problem passing this class. If you put some effort into the assignments and study a minimal amount for the exams, you should be able to pull off at least a B.  Tons of us breeze our ways to A's in this class. If you can't keep a B in this class you probably won't survive Upper Division CS classes.", 'I honetly think that this teacher has worse reviews than he deserves.  This was overall an easy class but I was kind of lazy so I did cut it really close with an A-.  The homework is pretty easy and straightfoward as are the tests.  Most of the coding tests are open book, open internet, and open homework, making them a breeze.', 'As with any CS course, you need to practice frequently to retain the material covered... and believe me, there is a lot of material to cover. Evan is a great guy with a really neat background. Most problems in this course stem from the CS department itself. If anything, Evan could do a better job managing his time towards the end of the semester.', "I'll be honest. I took him for 46B and this is where CS because the science of computing. Evan lectures and towards the end of the semiseter became lazy and still require us to know the material. He does give quizzes; a lot at the beginning and then few but it came harder. The structuring of the class is very structure and stuff. He seems legit.", "While 46A is an intro into Java programming, I believe 46B is meant to separate the wheat from the chaff. Merz has amazingly well thought out lectures. They are very concise and straight to the point. Never once did I experience Merz going off-topic. He is tough but it's because he wants to make sure you know your stuff. Excellent but tough teacher", 'Nice teacher. Will help if you ask.  Make sure you do the labs and HW yourself, lots of  the quizzes are just the previous homework.', "Merz is a great comp sci teacher. If you show up to class, do homework and labs on time, you'll get an A easily. He is one of the most patient teachers as well. People sit in class asking stupid questions yet he is still patient and is very open to help others. Funny guy as well. Anyone who says he is hard is lazy and wants an easy A Switch majors", "I had Merz for CS-151 last summer. His lectures were clear  interesting. His industry experience as a programmer gives good perspectives that you don''t get from most professors. Tests were very reasonable. Group projects were long  challenging in-class programming tasks were a mad race against the clock. Great instructor would take again.", 'Helpful class. Recommended.', 'Evan Merz is exceptionally friendly.  He is a younger professor so he relates well to students.  His desire to create a great class is sincere and obvious. Granted, he is somewhat inexperienced as a professor so he is still finding his footing. Nonetheless, I enthusiastically recommend him.  He wants students to learn and do well, and we do learn.', 'In class programming tests were extremely unfair. My lab instructor was even surprised how difficult the exams were and he said it took him 4 hours to complete the exam when he tried it himself. All of students were only given 75min. There are some people who have done very well in the class but it is because they have learned the material before.', "I don't know what these ratings are talking about regarding impossible exams and 12 hour homework. Once I started reading the book, the class got easy. I admit I failed every in-class coding exam, but that was me being a bad student, not Merz's fault. Coding is new to us, many of these bad ratings are because it's hard to learn. It's not his fault.", "Compared to CS46A, this is a real programming class and it will be hard, so take it seriously. I agree that he can be mildly hard to approach, but is generally friendly once you do. You CANNOT do his assignments the night before. Read the book, go to lecture and you'll have enough of an idea to get SOME points on coding exams and quizzes.", 'He expects you to know everything you learned in CS46A by heart. His coding assignments and quizzes are not that hard but his exams are just terrible. If you want to pass this class then you better do all your assignments and have B or better in the class before going into the finals.', 'Merz is a good programmer, but not a good teacher. His expectations for second semester programmers seem unreasonably high, and he refused to give additional practice problems or recommend videos when we were struggling with recursion. I thought his in-class coding quizzes/tests were overly challenging and his javadoc hard to understand.', "Unless you feel like you know more about java than any professor teaching a course in java would, don't take Merz. He claims he is approachable for help, but he is actually very rude and will make you feel useless and stupid.", 'I have programming experience so this was very easy. People saying he teaching is similar to "realworld" have not worked in the industry I assume. It is NOT like the way he teaches/codes,ask anyone in the industry and they\'d laugh how stupid and absurd his code is. From simple things like method naming to logic, the industry does not work this way.', "Lol'd at 12 hour assignment, considering it all averages out to about 12-18 lines of code per assignment and use of the basic sorts, recursion, and data structures. Merz happens to be a pretty good teacher who's just starting out, and slightly inexperienced .he's friendly and approachable if you decide to talk to him. willing to help if you want", 'He takes the joy out of programming with his 12 hour assignments and impossible exams.', "If you actually like programming and aren't only a CS major because you like video games, this class will be easy. expect to spend 1 hour per week on assignments. Exams were straight forward and not overly difficult. My only complaint is that Merz is too tolerant of people talking during lecture.", 'He expects far too much from his students, but does not give them the tools necessary in order for them to succeed. He is very unapproachable and it almost seems as though he takes out his own problems on his students.', 'If you like computer science then you will succeed.  Good professor if you are interested in learning.  He provides relevance to otherwise relatively abstract concepts.', "Very condescending guy that you wouldn't want to be near. If you aren't a great programmer, you'll end up not liking him. He made a programming exam very difficult to fully complete within 1 hour and never curved it. So expect to be stressed out in his courses.", "If you want to stay away of having an 80% risk of failing the class, don't take this professor. His exams are extremely hard. He wants you to do a perfect score in 75 min of exam time which is coding in class and his coding exams are very hard that it will take you about 4 days straight coding if you want to receive full points otherwise it be a 0", 'This was the worst instructor I have ever had. He is very condecending and useless. He could care less about his students and does his hardest to make sure no one is able to pass. He is very unapproachable and is just shy of forcing you to change your major. Do yourself a favor and stay away.'], 'Vidya Rangasayee': ['Professor Rangasayee is a wonderful DSA Professor. Though this is her last term at SJSU, I am reviewing her because this class was an eye-opening experience and great prep for future upper division CS classes. She may not be a quick email responder and takes time to grade, but is very nice if you ask for help and cares about your success.', "I already did my final. Yet the grades for half of my programs are still not in yet. You don't even know where you stand. She also looks very dull as if she hates when students ask her questions. I won't say this was a very challenging class as there was extra credit opportunities but the final was hard. But I would chose a different professor.", "Grade was made up of coding hw assignments(40%), 2 midterms(15% each), and final(25%). Only assigned 6 hw assignments and gave little feedback. Exams were a nightmare with 0 review and she was very inaccessible for help. Dont expect things to be graded quickly. Exams weren't curved at all despite the averages being 56% and 63%. She doesn't care.", "Very rude when asked questions, not very responsive. Makes questions which are vague and acts surprised when it's interpreted in multiple ways. \n\nDoesn't curve grades for midterms or show an accurate representation of your performance at all. You have no idea what's going on until near the end of the term or if you somehow calculate yourself.", 'Homework took many hours to complete, usually at least one coding assignment every week. The lectures were helpful but make sure to set aside a minimum of 10+ hours a week for this class. The midterms were pretty tough. Do not take this class if you want an easy A; take this class if you want to understand the topics and concepts.', "Her lectures are very helpful and provides many in class examples to explain the topics. The class is do-able, but need to put in the extra time to study. Midterms are pretty tough and there's one hw coding assignment a week that is pretty challenging. Also gives out ec throughout the semester.", "Grading system was very generous as 50% of it was the homework assignments. Tests were not that difficult. With an extremely stressful semester, this was my favorite class and professor. She gave me the least amount of stress. Show up to class, watch the videos, and you'll do good.", 'Previously I was on edge as I heard bad reviews.  This semester it seems, her teaching has gotten much better.  Lots of extra credit, assignments worth 50% of grade, and her lectures are very well planned this semester.', 'Professor Rangasayee knowledgeable of Object Oriented Design, and I learned a lot in her course. Her class is fairly programming heavy so be prepared to write some small applications. Her tests are mostly based on past homework assignments, but there may also be topics specifically from the textbook. Overall a solid choice for CS 151.', "Vidya struggles to teach the material clearly to the students. She has slides, which barely explains anything, and she talks rather quickly in lecture. She creates diagrams on the whiteboard, but isn't clear of what is going on. We had to self learn alot of the material to do the homework and exams. Homeworks are graded very tough. Get a good group", 'Awkward lectures. Teacher cannot find connection with students. She is unorganized, confusing. Find solid team for group projects. Be ready to teach yourself everything. Online midterm and final. Grading of the HW is merciless. Be ready that you will be smashed with the final project and the last 2-3 HWs. Try to take it with another professor.', 'Terrible professor. For example, she guided us to do for homework, but grader took points of on that. She is not very responsive if you send an email, and very slow grading. Also, dont trust what she puts on syllabus about grading policy. It is very difficult for you to know what your progress for her class is.', 'She talks in the whole lecture and seldom writes, a disaster for visual learners. She often arrives 10-15 min late for office hr and leave early sometimes She seldom pointed out my mistakes in my hw during office hr, then grader would give me low scores. Class HW avg 80 Tests are too long to be finished. Her exams are online, so many stu cheated.', "OK professor, I've had better. Stopped going to class midway because YouTube tutorials teaches me better and I just read the textbook. Oh and she doesn't grade your homeworks or midterm until like a month later so good luck knowing where you stand in the class. Assignments are 60% of the grade, find good group-mates to survive.", "Very disorganized. She would make mistakes and even lose focus during lecture (students had to correct her). She changed rules for the class many times, which caused confusion. Lecture slides and homework correlate little with exams, use Google to study. She even procrastinated with grading. Class averages were F's before curves (which were small).", 'She was quite disorganized, used slides straight from the textbook, and mostly read off of them. Came up with examples on the spot which were hard to understand. Maybe because it was her first semester teaching 146. Despite this, she was very generous with curves and extra credit at the end. She is very approachable and helpful in office hours.', 'Disorganized. Office hours limited, unhelpful and sarcastic. Copied 22 slides +homeworks from different websites. Expects you to already know everything by week 2 of the semester. Know C language. Go to lecture, she parrots the powerpoint back to you and jumps to different topics. Recommended: Youtube+ textbook+group study Good Luck.', "I didn't like her teaching style, she made lecture very boring and just used the slides from the book. I had a hard time learning in her class and her grader will tear your homework apart. She is very slow when it comes to putting in grades. Don't take her unless its your last option", "Lectures aren't very organized, not easy to understand/follow, aren't interesting or engaging; they're very plain. Gives you a lot of time to do the homework, so start early or you'll regret it!! Her homeworks/projects are not something you can do in just one day. Not very good at teaching new concepts or the material. Good luck teaching yourself.", "Her assignments are interesting, fun and hard and she's caring and kind.

Would take her class again.", 'One of the best CS professors I have come across. She brought cookies and muffins in some classes because the class was during lunch hours and none of us would participate. Assignments are difficult but interesting. Made me finally get into some real coding action. Not an easy A. Easy to fail though. Name your hw file wrong and embrace the zero.', "She used to work for Amazon, and she will teach you skills that are useful. Her lectures are boring at times, and you might get lost. She'll tell you what's important and what isn't. Tests are based on notes and the codes she uploads. She gave the class 3 weeks to do a project that had 11 pages of instructions. There are curves and Extra credits."], 'Alexandra Chakarov': ['146 is hard conceptually, but she makes you focus more on coding than theory, which made the class easier. Couple of HWs are tedious so get ready to debug for hours. Quizzes are easy and the grading interviews are simple: she asks you to walk her thru how your code runs the problem she shows you. Only negative is that lectures can get confusing.', 'i took her earlier for 46b. Compared to some of the other prof that teach that course, she is a good one. Sweet, caring professor and you can actually learn from the lectures. She does activities every lecture which might be annoying, but it helps learning material a lot. Tests are pretty straight-forward, no curveballs. Take her if you can.', "Really enjoyed Professor Chakarov for CS146. For me, the concepts and algorithms were broken down and explained well enough for learning for the first time. The visuals on her slides are effective and she's very responsive in and out of class. No exams/tests, just strictly hw, coding quizzes, 2 grading interviews, and a lightning talk at the end.", "Professor Chakarov was fairly average. She explained concepts during lecture well enough, but I felt like I didn't fully understand those concepts until I applied them on the homework or labs. There's some opportunities for a bit of extra credit if you do the in-class exercises. Also, she answers literal last minute questions on the class discord", 'Approachable, speaks clearly in not boring way, records lectures, slides online, syllabus publicly available. Tests and final were not too difficult. Hardest part of course was when we got to linked lists and material after. Take advantage of lab instructors and in class learning assistants.', 'Her lectures provided basically almost everything you need to know. No surprises. Her tests are based off lectures, in class exercises(extra credit opportunity in test category), and short quizzes from labs. She has a discord server and is easily reachable for help. Do HW early. HW is graded VERY thoroughly, so test every possible outcome in code.', 'Awesome lecturer and was very approachable. Homeworks were slightly on the more challenging side; however, because of this, it helped me understand the topics even better. Doing the in-class exercises and participating in-class activities is important as it will help you improve your understanding of certain topics.', 'The topics taught in class seem pretty straightforward and understandable, but then when they show up in the homework/labs, it feels super difficult. These homework assignments will eat up your time, so you definitely need to start them as soon as you can. You honestly learn the most from your labs thanks to the lab instructors.', "Decent lecturer and good personality, but there are so many mistakes / typos in homework. Most homeworks had at least one mistake, most of which require clarification. Labs are extremely difficult and many times multiple groups couldn't finish in time. Lab grading style changed mid semester.", "Intelligent + teaches topics well. Grades very generously + has resources like assistants, labs, etc. Assigns 1 hw every 1-2 weeks, but exams are handwritten. Pacing of topics + time spent on each thing is sometimes badly planned. Lecture slides aren't always helpful just diagrams + she expects us to code by ourselves with no knowledge. A w/ effort", 'Professor Chakarov is a good professor overall. Her exams are written and her lectures are helpful. The homework is challenging, but somewhat fun since you are learning something from it. During lectures there are in class exercises that can also help with learning a topic in order to understand it better. Great class.', "Really nice person and an easy class. But a new professor, so lectures are a bit confusing and she doesn't explain things the best way, slides are clunky and often can't be understood without the lecture. Also she stops for each question. Class is easy, quiz every week is pretty straightforward and labs/hw are for completion. No midterms.", 'Had a hard time paying attention in class.

Class was good, but very disappointed on her choice for the final.', 'The difficulty of course was moderate. We had weekly quizzes which were not that easy to score unless you have studied this subject nicely before taking this course. The final exam was subjective, many people ruined it as the exam was subjective and different from weekly quizzes.', 'Quizzes every week, lowest two scores are dropped. Just review her slides before them and you will be fine.', 'Lectures were awesome, especially because of the great animations to help understand each topic. Quizzes were lecture-oriented, so if you miss a class, you wont do well on quiz. But there are a lot of make up quizzes to replace lowest scores.

Badly structured/shallow course: you will not acquire a deep understanding/intricacies of various databases in his class\nYou may wanna take Prof. Kim's class instead", "This is course is vast, Professor Wu introduces concepts at a high level so the course involves reading, you need to work hard on the assignments which are long so start early! The course is good for gaining knowledge in data engineering if you put in the work and Professor Wu is a great grader so don't worry about grades! Attendance is mandatory.", 'Very caring professor. Extends deadlines for hw and exams. Written and programming assignments are tough, but they teach and reinforce the topics very well. Gives pop quizzes, access code given during the lecture. Curves the midterms/ final exams. Lecture slides are summaries of the textbook (CLRS). Overall great prof would def take again.', 'He has a lot of experience and you can see that clearly during his class. He tries to focus on the information that will help us in the real world. He is extremely caring about his students. He always asked if we wanted an extension on any of the assignments. Midterm and Finals are straightforward and a big project you work throughout the semester.', 'It was an incredibly informative class. I really enjoyed it and I use the foundational database skills I learned here all the time in group projects and my internship since I took it.', "The class wasn't the easiest, but I definitely learned a lot from his class. There's one midterm, one final, and a group project. The homework given to you are very helpful for practice for the exams. I recommend reviewing them often whenever given the chance. The group project will require a demo near the end of the semester.", 'Professor Wu is really a responsible professor. He is by far the best teacher I have ever had.', 'Professor really cares about students performance. Grading is fair and he gives you the second chance to learn from previous mistakes and to improve your final grade. He a nice Professor.', "Yea not really sure what happened to him in the past few years, but he became a really terrible professor. He grades his exams extremely harshly, you don't have much space on partial credit. If a problem is worth 10 points you can lose 15 point according to his grading criteria. Extremely unclear and expects you to read his mind on what he wants.", 'Professor Wu is very enthusiastic in teaching, and caring about his students. He is a tough professor but very passionate. Take him if you really want to have a job in IT career when graduating. Otherwise, I would recommend you not to take him. He provided tough homework and quizzes that help us concrete the knowledge.', "Not a fair grader, if you show up in his office hour every day and leave a good impression, you will get A for sure, even though you screwed up your midterm and final, that's not fair for the hard-working students who don't go to office hours. He's exams are really hard, there is no way to get A, if he doesn't have the impression in you.", 'This Big Data with Machine Learning course was a great experience because I learned new things and tools that help me found an intern.

In less than 6 weeks, we have to build a full functioning database application. Its very time consuming. I would suggest go for regular semester with Professor Wu but not the summer. Hes a nice Professor very helpful outside the class.', 'Each time when the assignment or exam come, he always say those are straightforward. However, at least half of people get C or lower grade on his midterm and final. It only shows how his teaching skill poor rather than how student cant study. All in all, you should avoid taking class with him if you dont want to learn everything online. (2/2)', 'It\'s a project heavy class to build a "Full Stack Web App Development Using Java (JSP, JDBC, Java Servlets, and Javascript) and Tomcat Web Server". It requires tons of time/effort, in return you got a solid WebApp at the end that you\'d be pride of. 4 HW\'s took long time + be wary of pop quizzes, but they reappeared in Midterm/Final, so worth it.', "Tough class (long programming assignments + homeworks + tests) but he's nice and you can try to get some points back by talking to him. Transition to online this semester kind of screwed us all over but he tried to do his best and he just focused on the chapters from the text book (Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition by Cormen). Just work hard", "Pros: Really cares for his students, assigns practical homework, & is super accessible/helpful outside of class Cons: Lectures can be difficult to follow; homework can be overwhelming as it is LONG; spends lots of time on irrelevant concepts, leaving no time for important ones. Pro tip: Participate & go to office hours as he's a subjective grader", 'Dr. Mike is very Knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the subject. He is an EXCELLENT teacher who is always willing to help and response to email quickly. Exams and HW are tough but very useful for my job interview. I am looking forward to taking his CS157A.', 'Professor Wu is the nicest Professor I have ever had. He was extremely helpful outside of the class. Pay attention to key concepts in his lectures and you will do great on exams. HE IS A MUST TAKE PROFESSOR!', "Professor Wu is very knowledgeable on the subjects he teaches, but he isn't good at teaching them. He zooms through concepts and assumes that his students have a lot of knowledge on certain subjects, and on a couple of occasions was fairly rude to students who asked about these subjects. He sent out a letter complaining about his poor SOTE reviews.", 'Professor Wu is super patient to his students low questions in the class. It ate up a lot of lecture time and delayed the lecture progress. Overall a great course.', "Prof Wu seems very enthusiastic about the topic, keep repeating how his class will help people find an internship. However, for this semester we spend 10 MINUTE total to cover Graph+DFS+BFS, which are some of the most important topics for interviews. We also didn't cover RBT, NP problems. Miss almost a month worth of content. PA and HW back to back", 'His lecture source is too simple. He is looking teaching well, but his lecture is nothing to help. He requires complicated concept. However his hw require complicated skills. His group project is also burden since the projects require frontend and backend system(HTML, REACT, Javascript). so ALWays he makes his students ask him weird questions alot.', "I cant begin to tell you how amazing Dr. Wu is at his job. He's the kind of teacher who will set a student up for success and will listen to the students to try to understand what he can do to better help them learn. He's very flexible with due dates if the class tells him they need more time. Also he's not offended by people negotiating for grades", 'Exams could be tricky, but had similar questions to homework and lecture. Professor Wu was very responsive over email, and could be reached outside of class. I walked away from this RDBMS course feeling more confident in my knowledge of the subject. Prof. Wu wants his students to succeed, his actions made this clear. Overall a great Professor.', 'Dr. Wu is a wonderful teacher and cares about success of his students. If you are looking to slack off and get by, his classes are not for you. To get a good grade, you genuinely need to work hard and be ready for pop quizzes, pop questions and challenging exams.', 'The database project was the best part of the course. We can choose any programming languages we are comfortable with to implement the web based 3 tiered database application. Its very industry oriented and my first web database-driven product ever. Do a good work. Professor Wu also referred students to Google for internship or job interviews.', "His semester project is way outside the scope of this class and more fitting for a web-developing course than an intro-DBMS course. Difficult exams, blows through lecture slides that he takes from other universities and doesn't fully explain the concepts. Arbitrary grading criteria (one HW has no partial credit because reasons??). Definitely avoid.", 'Truly cares about his students and by far one of the best professors in CS over my 3 years. His HWs and exams are difficult but very helpful to learn the concepts. He is very knowledgeable with industry experience and is very accessible. I sent him hw questions around 1am and I was surprised that I received reply right away. He is a great teacher.', 'I had CS146 and CS156A from Professor Wu. He is AMAZING! He is my best professor at SJSU. He is always there to answer questions and help. Pop quizzes and exams are tough, but you gain a lot things from it. You will love the team database application project. I put it in my Github for my resume.', 'He is not ready for his lectures with his test and projects yet. His tests and hw projects require much higher level knowledges, but his ppt and lecture sources are ridiculously simple and rough. Every week, pop quiz is provided. Final project : designing website with your team member. Almost 6-7units. His accent is also difficult to understand', "Dr. Wu is a good professor, he tries to help students as much as he can (as long as you try as well). His exams are hard if you don't study, programming assignments are hard but you learn a lot from them. Homeworks are lengthy, so start early. Write down whatever he writes on the board, it can be on a quiz or midterm. Pop-Quiz every week, prepare", 'After CS146 with Professor Wu, I found that I have improved a lot of concepts and skills in data structure and algorithm throughout the semester. In addition, I have also gained more interest in coding after completing his tough assignments. Thus, I believe that I am almost well-prepared for my next coding interview after taking his CS146 class.', 'Easily one of my favorite CS professors. The material itself is difficult and he understand that it is difficult. The programming assignments are very general as long as it fulfills his requirements. The exams and pop quizzes can be very difficult but he tries his best to curve your grade based on the class average. Overall, a very good professor.', 'Really passionate guy. Programming assignments and tests are long and hard, BUT he is generous is giving you ways to make up your grade. This semester he let people redo their mistakes for partial credit for the first midterm, and curved the second and final. Try your best even when it gets hard and ask questions. He wants you to succeed too.', 'Each programming assignment need to write a report. If your report is not good enough he will take lots of points off from the written report for example 50% deducted from your score even your code works fine. Tests are difficult and the pop quizzes almost every week. His attitude is kind only for good students.', 'The class almost done, I will definitely miss him. He is the best professor ever. He is always there for us to help us out. Every time go to his office, and ask him questions, he always explain patiently. He even add extra office hours, and comes to the office often on Friday, or weekends to help us. The hw and projects are well designed.', "It's hard to understand him and reading textbooks is a must to pass the course. Coding assignments are back to back and very hard if you are not comfortable with to Java and data structure in CS 46A/B. His exams are very long and time consuming. You don't even have time look at his given notes. Pop quizzes once in so beware.", "Mike Wu is a great teacher. He's very passionate about teaching and inspiring students to study well for industry jobs. Make sure to attend every lecture and stay on top of coding assignments. He curves and gives extra credits so I found his class easier to pass than other CS146 classes. Also, make sure you learn Java before taking him.", 'I retook CS 146 and did so with his class. He will give you opportunities and chances to show that you understand the material and you get the grade you deserve. I was able to understand this subject better thanks to him and he will go out of his way to help you if you ask. You get an occasional laugh during class as well.', "This is the only review you ever need: 1- Prof Wu curves your grades and extends deadlines often (got C's on midterms and final but total grade is B) 2- Tests are very difficult and long. 3-Assignment instructions are horribly unclear, but not hard. 4- Study everyday's lecture for the pop quiz (seriously) 5- No laptop in class", "I am in his data structure and algorithms class Spring 2019. I love his teaching style, funny, nice, and Knowledgable. One of the greatest professors I've have taken at SJSU. Really cares about the success of his students. Very understanding and humorous guy. I am really enjoying taking his class.", 'Professor Wu is super considerable and knows the connection between the material in books and the implementation in industry. He is trying to make all the students to catch up, and he spends so many time to help students to improve their performance of this course after class. He is always energetic and passionate during his lectures.', 'Professor Wu is a vey nice professor. He gave interesting programming assignments, lots of assignments, and pop quizzes to make students learn. I recommend Professor Wu to those who want to understand and do well in Data Structures and Algorithms.', "Professor Wu isnt a very good professor. He can't even pace his own class. I'm not sure if it was just our session or if the other sessions had issues too, but he would go extremely slowly at the beginning of the semester, then he would realize he was going to slow and try and speed through everything, not giving enough time to learn the concepts.", 'Terrible attitude in class and out of class. Says that no questions are stupid questions but if you do ask him a question that he thinks is stupid, he will make fun of you in class. Really rude and hard to approach.', "He is great. I went to his office to ask questions and he was always very nice and clearly answered my questions. He wouldn't mind meet me on Friday or even Saturday because my class schedule conflicted with all his office hours.", "Dr. Wu is one of the best profs I've ever had. He's extensive industry experience and very knowledgeable in the field. After finishing my programming hws, I got so much great concepts of how Google search engine and Facebook work in using data structures and algorithms. I would say that if you dont miss class and ask questions, you should be OK.", "Gives long homeworks and projects so that there isn't even enough time to prepare for the tests. Doesn't explain concepts clearly in class, so a lot of it will rely on yourself being able to study. Test questions are very long as well", "Really bad professor. Says you can email him or go to his office hours but there was a few times I went to his office hours to ask a question or debug my code and he didn't even try to help me at all. His tests are really long too, many people didn't even get to finish the midterms both times.", "Although Dr. Wu isn't the best lecturer in the word, he is definitely one of the best professors that I've had so far. He is very knowledgeable and very approachable outside of class and always encourages you to ask him questions if you have any. He is a tough but fair grader. You will learn the concepts very well in his class.", 'Professor Wu is an excellent Computer Science professor. He cares about the success of all of his students, and he tries his best to ensure everyone in his class learns the material. He can be a tough grader, but he is also fair. I would highly recommend him to any student looking to take data structures and algorithms.', 'Professor Wu cares about the learning progress of students and is very responsive to questions. I learned a lot of concept and skills in Big Data from this course. Some of homework assignments are challenge and time consuming, but very useful and practical. I have found an intern job in Silicon Valley. This is a must-take graduate class.', "Dr. Wu is a really nice guy and cares about his students. He is so much more approachable than the other CS146 teachers, very responsibe email. He's also flexible with deadlines when students ask for it (big life saver). Of course being 146 its still a challenging class. Very fair grader. It's not mandatory to attend but it helps you stay updated.", 'Great professor and very knowledgable in the topics. I enjoyed his class very much.', "Dr. Wu struggles with teaching, but he's nice, respected and highly accessible. I love how much he cares about student's success and his experience in the field (Google). His tests and assignments are not bad (hard sometimes), but I wish he could bring more coding interview questions to programming assignments. He grades easily, with curve, though.", "Wu is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. He respects you as a student, and will go out of his way to help. His lectures are very mediocre, you will need to study to pass this class. The concepts are hard and you can't retain all the material by attending lecture. Wu will RECOMMEND YOU for jobs if you do well in his class and he likes you.", "Professor Wu is a good teacher. His teaching is kinda meh..... you need to spend time study more by yourself. But he always answers your questions no matter what time you email him. And his test is not that easy, but if you spend time perhaps, it's not super hard either. Plus he gave lots of 2nd chances for students to improve if they doing badly on the midterm."], 'Ty Lin': ['Ty Lin seems like a great guy. Love his classes, always looking forward to them , because he is so nice and motivating.', "I've never been more confused in all my school years. He is very disorganized.

However you dont have much of a choice with his subject.', "Database is an important class, so please don't waste yours on him.", "Adamant, vague, confusing. In the two lectures I stayed for, Lin was very insistent that we all have Visual Studio (even if it meant installing another OS). He threatened to drop anyone who couldn't get it, despite there being more viable alternatives to VS. The advice he gives is questionable; he told me the C# template I had was fine (it wasn't).", "Horrible teacher. Barely lectures during class time, and continually talks about his project his students have contributed to over the years. It's nearly impossible to understand what he is saying; he doesn't clarify details at all. Gives sporadic quizzes 5 minutes after an unclear lecture. Probably the worst class I've taken in my life.

Class topic can be helpful for your study but lecture is NOT useful', 'Absolutely and unequivocally the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life.

His moto is to torture students', 'Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class.', 'Worst professor I have ever had. Horrible lectures and repeats the same lectures over and over.

Tried to defend his poor teaching by showing student evaluations from 10 years ago and then bash the rest of the teachers as SJSU for not publishing as much as him.', "Don't ever take his subject. He is horrible, he takes tests but never grades them. U don't have to work in his subject and u learn nothing.", 'Bad lecturer. Disorganized. Learned very little about assembly. Stayed on one topic for the entire semester. Keeps poor records of grades.', "He's a great programmer but a pretty bad professor. He's useless unless you can understand what he's trying to say.

Avoid it guys....", 'Absolutely the worst instructor I have ever had. His lectures are unorganized, unclear, and repetitive. Taking his class was a waste of my time and money. Save yourself the trouble and avoid him at all costs. Lin should not be given the right to retire; he should be fired as soon as possible.', "The worst teacher. I got an A in the course, so I am not bitter. Previous reviews are true. A third exam a week before the final is proof of his disorganization. Waited until the final day to inform us that only the top 10% (out of 25 students) will receive A's regardless of overall %. The head of CS has received many complaints about Lin.", "He really likes to talk about himself. He lectures about the same thing for a few weeks, which you don't learn anything new in the class.

He knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to lecture.", "Do not take this teacher. First of all he only speaks about himself most of the class time.

Really appreciated that he had 1-1 office hours instead of lectures during midterm weeks.", 'The material we learned was very hard, but Fabio did a great job simplifying it for us. Always checked to see if we understood what was going on. Workload was VERY manageable (4 HW, 2 midterm projects, final project). Usually ended class 5-10 min early which was nice. Recorded lectures too. I only wish he had clear grading rubrics for projects tho.', "He goes over the material with nice pacing. As long as you attend all lectures, which do not feel boring at all, you should be able to easily pass the class.

Tough class but awesome guy :)", "Fabio is very understanding with everybody's time and grade but do not go into this class expecting an easy A.

I took this as a graduate elective, and keep wishing that I could take more classes with him! Lectures are easy and final projects are interesting, where you choose your level but he'll grade fairly. He is focused on security of web applications, and gets you interested in it too.", "The class is graded in 4 sections of 25% each, so really make sure you don't mess up on the midterms or miss a hw. Fabio is a security expert in explaining the concepts; I personally found the class pretty confusing if you don't go, so I highly recommend it. Midterms and final are all online. Class was pretty interesting material. Amazing professor", 'Super chill guy, good sense of humor. Material is very straight forward and for the class project you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want and he will grade it fairly.

The projects he assigns each semester are really worth working for to show off on your resume.', 'Extra credit helps a lot', 'Fabio cares about his students. If you ask for help, he will get back to you asap. Many complained about the exam being too hard though. Records his own lectures to youtube if you ask him to.

His grading criteria can be a bit unclear though, and a small deduction can drop your grade quite a bit.', 'Professor Fabio is one of the best professors I have taken a course with at San Jose State. He teaches really well and explains all of the important information to the students. His slides contain all the information you will need and are very thorough. I would definitely take another class with him.', "Fabio is pretty smart and fun to listen to, always backs up for clarification when needed. Will sometimes boost everyone's test scores if class average is below passing. Very little work, however every point counts if you want an A.

He even helped me with stuff from my other class. The grading is fair enough.  I would definitely take him again if have the chance!', "Great teacher. Keeps his lectures short and uses the time after lecture for questions. The homework can be a bit tricky if you don't attend the lecture. If you study the slides well enough though you will do fine. His tests are based upon his homework assignments and the slides. The final was very straight forward and fair. Great teacher.", "Lectures are fairly vague and always ended about 30 minutes early (good bc less time spent at lecture and bad bc it wasn't engaging enough and were fast-paced). Never found his lectures helpful bc the material is straightforward if you read book and slides.

Pretty chill overall, no complaints from me.', "1st half of the semester, he lectures on project management, agile/scrum, etc. with easy weekly hw. Second half is team project which is using a CMS to build a website. He doesn't grade anything as other teams grade your project milestones and TA grades hw and final milestone. Project EC is determined by participation in your team's discord server.", "The class is supposed to be software project, but he teaches scrum and agile for the first half of the semester and then gives a useless tool to make a website that a 5 year old could do as well. Doesn't grade anything himself, the other groups grade you. Midterm and final are mcq, but they are super confusing and super difficult to get good marks.", "The professors instructions are vague. He gives assignments that could have several correct answers but only gives you a good grade if they are answers that he likes. This class is like hoping to learn to drive by just reading the DMV handbook without ever driving. You won't learn to be a better software engineer from learning the material.", "Material is good, but professor is monotone and makes it very difficult to listen in class. Goes on random tangents which makes it hard to follow the lecture. Grading is very unclear, we were graded on participation for group project and it seem like it was determined based on how many messages you wrote on your group's discord server... Very picky", "His lectures are pointless. He goes over a lot of topics but, those topics feel like busy work. His assignments are easy. Don't expect to learn much from this class. The project is about making a dynamic website but, we are not really making a website. We use a tool called Drupal that does all the work. We just provide the content of the website.", "It's weird. The first part of the semester, you're just learning about some vague stuff on software development stages. Therre will be a couple homework assignments that are easy. But the problem is the group project. The project is about making dynamic website, yet we never learn about how to make one. Lecture is random rambling on CS151 topic.", "Professor Tseng gives great feedback. You will have homework every week but if you pay attention in class, you will get a 100/100 easily.

He is a very good grader so don't worry about grades.", "Good material, bad explanation. He's really hard to understand, partially because of his English, but mostly due to the way the explain things. He jumps from one point to another in the code (using search terms), making it impossible to follow the logic. Doesn't really give feedback to what you're doing wrong.", 'Took him over winter session for 46a, overall the class was very fast paced but he tried to catch us up whenever possible. He did not always explain information to the fullest but he did provide links for us to read later on. He also put a high emphasis on certain topics (sometimes telling us what would be on the exams) to assist the students.', "He read slides to us about agile and program management. Does a couple of online classes with HTML and JSON. But 2/3 of the class is the projects, and his grading rubric is the stupidest thing ever. It's based on what the other group rated you as and what your peer grade you as. The FINAL PROJECT is 30% of your grade (everyone got 90-100). Stresful", "Don't take him for 160 or 174 unless you're taking a 1-class semester for some reason. His project has confusing directions and will overlap with finals week to make both his class and other classes harder to pass.", 'Unhelpful tbh. He expects you to know the material by heart. Within 2 weeks he "covered" 6 chapters!!! Don\'t take him, his hw assignments are nerve wracking, plus the TA grades unfairly. His guidelines for the class project are extremely vague, more than half the time I\'m confused about what to do. I woulda taken someone else if available.', "Do the homework and your final project as those two are the biggest parts of your grade.
