Michael Beeson,/professor/3,3.1,N/A,3,"Well... the subject of differentials & linear algebra is hard. That said, he does try to make it as easy as possible by using variation of example problems on the midterms. Sample midterm/ final was just like the real exam. Study, Study, Study. Got by this class by self-learning everything from khan academy and youtube. Textbook is useless, Math 123 can be one of the hardest courses for engineering students at SJSU. Therefore, I believe that Prof. Beeson has done the best he could. I dont know why people keep complaining about partial credit, but I agree with his point of view - If you want to become an engineer, you are not allowed to make mistakes. Thats life, deal with it., Prof. Beeson is extremely apathetic to students, he does not care if you pass or fail. On exams, he does not give any partial credit, which is extremely odd for a math class. Even if you did the problem correct but made a mistake, you lose all your points for one question because Mr. Beeson expects you to be perfect. Strongly do not recommend him, I sleep in class and I still manage to average a B grade for the 3 midterms., Hes so boring and even makes me feel sleepy. I always plays computer games during classes and have to learn the knowledge by myself, 2 midterms, 1 final. 10 questions total, and doesnt give partial credit or any extra credit. His voice is very monotone, making it difficult to pay attention. Whats worse is trying to understand his handwriting. Half the time, I couldnt read what he wrote because it was so tiny and pretty much chicken scratch. Try to avoid taking him., Decent professor, knows his material really well but isnt effective in teaching it to other... tests and exams arent too bad they are similar to the sample exams he gives... similar concepts just different problems... quizzes time to time... be prepared to learn the majority of the lectures on your own..., DO NOT take this professor, terrible at speaking and explaining. Tests are only a few questions and a lot of points. Gave one section an easier final than the other, and does not give partial credit., I took calculus before so the class wasnt as hard however, his tests are only 10 problems usually and each is worth a ton and he doesnt give partial credit usually so you have to exact. No calculators for his class and random quizzes in class from time to time. Hw is easy all done on an online program no effort, will you learn calculus, maybe., This proffesor is a total joke, avoid him at all costs. He manages to take a not too challenging subject into something impossible., Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.        Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class., Beeson is one the first professors that I had at SJSU. He lives and breathes the CLRS book. His lectures are very clear, but the projects, which account for 50% of the grade are difficult, so work on them early. Tests were easy and open book. Come to lecture and take notes!, He analyzes everything you say like a bad shrink. The other commenter wasnt kidding when they said he stops for minutes at a time to contemplate the next step. Heard of planning? No calculators, which would be fine except that some test questions are ridiculous without one (eg. plug 5/4 into 4x^3+15x^2+12x+6. Actual step in a final exam Q), Because he spent several years creating his math software, he believes its the ultimate teacher when teaching calculus.  Hes apathetic to students, expects so much from them. Very unclear, boring. Ive never had a math prof. who pauses for days thinking whats the next step to take in a math problem., Smart and very nice teacher. Good teach style. Lector is organized. Know how to teach student. know how to separate the section and assignment, then student could learn step by step. Not push too much. You need to read the book before listen the lecture. Learn a lot from the course. Very useful course overall., Very hard homework but easy tests.  If you listen to the lectures and attend class you will do great, reading the book is mostly optional., Hes a damn good professor but he can be a bit of a jerk sometimes.  I was in the section where he yelled at the whole class for 30 minutes because half of the people in both sections failed the 2nd midterm.  Just keep up with the lecture notes, study before midterms, and do all the HW.  You should do just fine., Beeson is one of the best teachers Ive had at this school.  Its a hard class, but he explains things well. Ive never met a teacher that was as willing to help students as this guy.  Hell take a later bus home to santa cruz if people still need help!  Dont take this class with any other teacher. Trust me., Beeson is a hardass when it comes to grading but if you prepare for his class every day you will benefit. He  cares about you coming to class and doing all the daily problems, you will come out of this class ready to produce industry level code. He seems to care deeply about the quality of engineers sjsu pumps out, that is you, better study!, Hes a little nuts but hes very smart and is really interested in the subject of CS146.  Id strongly recommend him for that class., If you want to flunk, take his class. He assumes you can learn on your own, write your own code without his lecture or explanation. Not to mention he is a good knowledgeable professor but he cant teach. He has to transform his knowledge to the  students which he doesnt do. Borrow code from already taken friends to get an A. Coming from a B+ stude, READ THE GREEN SHEET.  Beeson is one of the best teachers at SJSU.  Actually tries to get his students to think.  READ THE WHOLE GREEN SHEET.  If you do ALL the lab preparation exercises and attend EVERY lab, then the homework, midterms and final will be  easy.  Seriously though, make sure you READ THE ENTIRE GREET SHEET., You have to stay engaged in this class throughout the semester to do well. If you read the lecture notes and practice them labs will flow easy for you. Midterms are fair assuming you have been doing the work. Overall hes a very good professor that will teach you a lot--if you let him., You MUST do homework during lab. So only about one hour to finish your homework or you get a C. You have to read lectures at home and do them on your own time. This was changed as of fall 2008. Very confusing instructions and professor not very helpful at all. AVOID him! Youre better off learn on your own, he does not teach., He is a terrific teacher.  Read the assigned text before coming to class or you will be lost in the lecture.  Read your notes when you go home.  Dont just DO the HW.  Do more than the assignment asks until you understand the topic.  Do every program ON TIME.  Miss one and you will fail.  First sign of trouble, see him during office hours., 10-12 labs, six assignments, two midterms, and one final. He makes sure that we are engaged throughout the semester. Clarifies every question and responds back with sufficient suggestions. As per grading, you get what you earn!, This class is easy as long as you attend lecture and write the code prior or afterwards.  Lab is mandatory and consists of EXACTLY what you cover in lecture.  He goes slightly off from his notes online which is why lecture is important to attend.  Very enjoyable lectures and happy to help out at office hours.  Your grade is the effort put in!, Knows a lot about programing, but is one of the worst teachers ive had! does not put a lot of time in helping students; really lazy, and bad handwriting on the board. Makes a lot of mistakes in the class, but if you make the smallest mistake on HW or test, you lose a lot of points!, One of the quirkiest professors I\ve had.  Given to tantrums when students arrive late.  Doesn\t seem prepared for lecture, but that may be relevant to first class in the day (presume he\s rehearsed for later sections).  Exams are open book/notes, but are hard. Mandatory programming are HARD! Missed assignments result in an F in the course!, A great teacher! is kind of lazy trying to grade hw and stuff, but you get what you put into the class... very helpful!, One of the worst profs SJSU has. Totally illegible in his teaching. spends little or no time explaining the subject clearly. i feel bad having such a prof for such an interesting subject., I am not sure what other people are talking about. CS130 is the easiest class I have taken at SJSU. His classes consist of coding in front of students and showing every detail that was on the exams. He does require you to attend labs and complete homeworks, so it does take some coding effort - but if you are in CS you should probably do it..., Good professor. BUT his exam is always including  new material that he didnt teach in class which could kill your grade. Its like Hey class I got Surprise for you!!!. So, half of class this Fall 2006 got an F on the final exam( 23 students), 6 students got D, 8 students got C, 5 students got B , and yes there are 24 favorite A students of him., Got A in his class Fall 2006. Few friends who good at programming didnt do too well so Im speaking for everyone. He screwed up big time on his 2nd midterm by not mentioning in his spec that the dialog should be initialized by fields on the main form. As a result, blind mindless idiots just followed the homework and got As because he stopped gradin, he is a useless prof...very unfair grader. gives an f if u dont submit even 1 assignment. he is a pathetic moron, very unfair on grading. unclear lectures. he doesnt know what hes saying. unprepared lectures., DONT take 146 from him. A) He doesnt know Java very well. B) if you miss even ONE assignment during the semester, you get an F in the class. Even if you turn in all of them, if you dont do well on 2-3, you will still get an F, regardless of test grades. Also randomly assigned more work, flunk you if you dont do it, but not give points if you do, This class is the most fun of all the CS classes. The hws are fun and he gives you a lot of hints. The midterms and finals are cake since all you do is write a short program in lab. He gives you many opportunities to get an A+. If you do not get an A in this class you should change your major., well prepared and organized, speaks well. If you study the class notes youll pass the class easily. if you put in a bit more effort youll defenitelly get a good grade. I liked the class and the teacher, not a hard class at all, but dont be lazy. (it helps if you read the notes before the class, then its much easier to get/remember the content), Class is very easy. His notes are online, so you never need to go to class and the lab is just about following directions and looking up class notes. Grading is easy and only based on programming, no major tests. He teaches by code, not through a book. Its an easy A+, but then again, its C#. You right click and program practically writes itself., This teacher is just awesome!!! Very well prepared lectures and clear samples. Not afraid to give an A. Do all the homework, run the samples, and you are set. I think the course is very good for future cs programmers who do want to program., taking his class is a waste of time.  i could learn windows programming on my own.  his final is stupid, he doesnt even other looking at the code you write., Pretty horrible professor with time management issues. Spends a good portion of each lecture talking about nothing, and ends up going over in time because he didnt finish the lecture. Class is really easy. You dont need to go to class, just practice the online notes. Cant really teach but tries., Dont get excited if you get As by beggining of the course. By 3 quarter of semester you most likely to get Bs, & C on final! In the beginning you know exactly what you doing, however, at the end you have no clue! The guy says to cutnpaste code from his website & dont bother understanding it!, The beginning of the course is fun, since the prof. goes into a lot of details. However, he wastes a lot of time talking about irrelevant stuff and ends up catching up at the nd of the course. Too much stuff left unexplaned, but asked on the finals! You have to surf the web to find many answers!!!, Hes an alright teacher, you dont really have to go to the lectures, just read the notes and try the stuff for yourself to make sure you get it. I went to his office hours a couple times, pretty helpful; and you cant argue with XP Pro for 7 bucks., Hella easy class. Most people end up getting As. You dont even have to go to class. All his lecture notes are posted online. His lectures are boring anyway. Make sure you do the practice midterms before you go into the real ones., Hes a decent guy, although you have to sit through a lot of pure talk and not even take any notes. Labs and hw are what count, and its easy to follow if you follow his online notes. I recommend him., Arrogant!!!!!!!!!!!!  He will mention his stupid MathXPert program at least a hundred times.  He enjoys reprimanding his students.  Very difficult to communicate with.  Dont take this jack@$$!, One of the more arrogant teachers in the CS department. Dont bother going to his office hours unless you are first in line.  He usually spends all his time helping 1 student. The material is good but when you ask him for help he is difficult. Study notes, His online lecture notes make up the textbook and they are really helpful.  He walks you through the homeworks.  Everything is channeled through his web site so you never have to worry about missing things if you miss class. Labs are easier then they look, Great guy. Pretty easy class. Grade pulled down by really hard multiple choice take home quizes. Lectures are really boring., wants to help, but sometimes stumbles over words., Better make sure that you do your own work or the final is a B*tch"
Yan Chen,/professor/2628898,3.3,62%,3.1,"minimal guidance on concepts and assignments. Be prepared to deal with assignments and mini-projects on your own. The course is demanding and requires significant time and effort because you need to self study a lot cause she wont teach anything. Consider other options if possible, She has a strong accent, so its hard to catch what shes saying sometimes. Lectures are just her reading straight from the slides, so honestly, its easier to just check the slides she posts on Canvas later. If youre really trying to learn Java, this probably isnt the best way. I ended up watching YouTube tutorials to make sense of the material., The positive feedback here seems to focus only on her lenient grading and skipping the final exam. However, she cant  teach effectively fundamental topics, making it feel like you have to learn all by yourself without a teacher. Consider other options if theyre available., She generously offered extra credit opportunities and reviewed solutions during class.  I highly recommend attending her class regularly. The final project may be challenging, but she provides valuable feedback and allows for resubmission.  The class is quite manageable., I took Yan Chens 166 this semester and thought it was great. +-30% extra credit from optional HW, +3% EC if you get >50% on midterms, and you can substitute your final grade with the sum of your midterm scores and EC on top. She cares about her students and makes the class accessible and fun. I recommend doing lots of EC; little time on exams., 175 is fairly straightforward. The class is structured to teach things, mostly through exercises and projects. It is up to you however to decide what you learn and dont learn from the class, if you use it for the term project or not. Is very easy to get an A., Would only recommend the class if you want the credit for the course. Mostly self-learning from her lecture videos and slides. Do all the extra credit (especially the project) and you should be very fine, even if you bomb the final., Terrible lecturer. Talks fast with heavy accent and doesnt give time to digest what she rambles about, let alone take notes. She records, but if you go in person she goes over solutions to assignments. You can choose to skip final if you do the project(very difficult). Easy if you just want to pass. If you actually want to learn, take Ahmad., Dont know why rating is so low, She gives lots of extra credit and wants you to pass. Accent is bit hard to understand at first, but lecture slides are enough to study and pass. Attendance is not mandatory but if you attend exercise qs are discussed which are useful. As long as you are doing weekly work, passing this class is easy., Genuinely have no clue why her ratings are so low. Chen is a great lecturer and her slides are clear. Pay attention in class and everything should be fine. Her accent is perfectly understandable. Do all the HW. The group project is very digestible when broken into parts., Try get more EC, and do the project even if it is optional. This class is not that hard. Be prepared to read., Despite what other people may say about Professor Yan Chen, in my experience I thought she was a wonderful professor. Although her grading may seem harsh being that most of the grade is based on your final score, her lectures are very insightful and help a lot on material covered in exams. She is also very passionate about the topic as well., No idea why her reviews are so terrible. Shes a decent professor and her class structure makes it nigh-impossible to fail. Her classes typically have a very high average final grade. Course gets harder over time but youll have the option to add a percentage of your project score/HW score to your final. If you just try, you will end up with a B/A., Gives up to 30 pts of extra credit if you do all the optional assignments. Her lectures are straightforward, but she goes fast. She also records lectures and goes over the assignments in detail every class which is nice. Responds to emails quickly. Final used questions that were extremely similar to the optional assignments., Shes a bit hard to understand, but honestly I kind of enjoyed the class format. She posts all lectures and slides online, and your only homework is a weekly Canvas quiz. The grading is entirely final based, and your homework contributes as EC with an optional project to boost/replace grade. Completely manageable class, iffy prof., She has a heavy accent and could barely hear it. She reads everything off the slides in her lectures, so dont bother to go to the lectures, just read the slides she posts in Canvas later that day. If learning Java was your goal, this might not be it. Decided to watch YouTube tutorials about the lectures to understand them better., The weekly quizzes ramp up in difficulty exponentially, which super annoying. When she goes over the problems for the weekly quizzes she just does it and disregards that 90% of the class felt like unaliving themselves due to the difficulty of the problem. Project is also impossible, ITS EVEN a 4 person group project and still is impossible, Youll be fine taking her as long as you put adequate (not crazy) amount of effort into the class. Her lecture is really organized and she tried her best to explain the problems., Yan Chen is a great professor, but she speaks too fast, also if u take notes, dont even bother, you will miss important information. Weekly Quizzes, and her grading scale is easy to pass, kinda of difficult to get an A, but for sure you can get an passing grade most definitely. Overall she is far better than Ahmad who teaches 154 aswell., Bro this teacher cant speak english. If your taking CS or Software engineering pick someone else because she cant teach. She has the strongest chines accent to the point where you cant understand her. And if you ask her a question, you might as well ask her in Chinese. \nPICK SOMEONE ELSE., Chen definitely should get a higher rate. Take advantages for every possible EC/Assignments/Quizzes...and try your best to attend each lectures as they are helpful. Group project is not easy, but its optional. Follow the course progress, then everything is manageable - even get a good grade. Prof. is willint to help you improve grade if needed., I got an A in Summer 2023. I learned a lot from her. I agree that the final is 100pts which is the overall grade. But she offers 30pts of EC, 70pts for the project; both are optional. I took the final instead. It was way easier than the project. Some questions are exact or similar to the quizzes. To get an A, please do the 30pts EC with the final., Absolutely excellent class, does not deserve such a low rating. Solid curriculum, class is quite interesting, and offers an online option for those who do not want to come to class in person. Final is the entire class (100%), but the class offers around 60% of extra credit in the form of normal assignments and projects., Honestly not sure why Yan Chen has such a low average. Imo, shes a top g. Once you understand her grading, you can take real advantage and not even take the final. My only criticism is that she can speak quite fast at times. Highly recommend!, Not sure why people are saying she cant teach regarding CS154, I feel like I learned more from her compared to Ahmad who has a higher rating. (Im retaking with her). She could go a bit fast, but shes organized and is accessible., I am surprised the rating is so low. To me, she is ok. She puts lots of effort in lectures and homework, and responds email quickly. Sometimes she cant explain topics in depth though., I dont think a 2/5 is warranted, Ive taken way worse profs with higher RMP scores. Easy class, if you put in the work you can learn. Lots of extra credit; grading system is confusing, but if you do all the assignments you can skip the final exam to get an A., The only positive reviews here refer to her easy grading and not taking the final. Unfortunately, she cant teach the basic subjects so you are better off with no teacher. Avoid her if you have other options, if you do well on the term project + extra credits, you will get an A without taking the final., Teach you 1 + 1 = 2, the homework is to ask you to answer Calculus, Extremely dangerous professor. No proper explanation of concepts and you are on your own for assignments and mini projects. Very time consuming course. Avoid, Clear grading criteria and an easy class in general. You will learn some fundamental topics of information security, including cryptology, authentication/authorization, hash, etc. 2 midterms and 1 final, and the average of 2 midterms can cover final, which is awesome because you may not need to take the final!, She puts too less effort in teaching as she told us she is looking for another full time job. Dont expect much from teaching as she cant explain anything. Most of the material I had to learn myself from youtube videos as her lectures worth zero. Assignments outdated and constantly updated AFTER being assigned. Didnt get much from this class :), - There are 25 points of extra credits so you could get up to 125 points. I got 115 points last semester.\n- You can get an A if you have 93 points, so easy A for me\n\nExercises and Projects took a lot of time. The professor was nice if you talk to her. Why there are many bad reviews; maybe it is because they dont want to do too much homework, Grading may seem scary as the Final is 100%, but the lecture slides help a lot to understand materials. There are about 30 points of extra credit for doing assignments and discussions. Lots of questions in the Final are exactly from assignments or similar. Overall is not a hard class, really like her lecture slides as they explain concepts clear., As long as you do the assignments, guaranteed to pass the class. Grading criteria is not difficult to understand. The class was extremely boring. She just reads off the slides and holds the class there till the end of class time even if there is no content left., Pros: Class is project based. We did a few mini projects and a final project. Every exercise is well designed, which helped me to understand the material in depth. Quiz is optional; Cons: she read off the slides. Its hard to understand the content without a demo., She teaches a lot in class. It is beyond what can fit into one semester. She talks fast as she rushes against time and brushes off questions. She only covers the basics, cant explain in depth. Difficult exams., Other than her going too fast and not going extremely in depth, her lectures are straight forward and also uploads recordings on Canvas. She provides a lot of extra credit opportunities so it should be relatively easy to get a passing grade. Midterm and finals are long but are questions that youve encountered before. Would recommend., Not too bad! Has office hour appointments available if you need more help. Weekly assignments are simple, based from lectures and are EC. Also has easy discussions that are EC. Exams are time-crunched, so you need to work fast. Okay explainer of concepts and wished she talked slower. Project is long and hard: maybe better to do final exam instead., No clue why people complain about grading criteria, its an easy to understand points system. You need 70 points to pass out of the total 130 you can earn throughout the class from assignments and exams. She is very caring, gives extensions if students need and grades quickly. Lecture slides are presented in an organized and concise way. Take her!, The most wholesome professor ever. Short, simple lectures. Easy quizzes. Grading system is not confusing as what other reviews state. 130 possible POINTS total, just need 93 POINTS to get A. Shes not lazy to grade because she has graders who help her and she once spent her whole night to grade the project so that we know if we need to take final, Honestly, idk why her rating is so low. She is very caring and a good teacher and I really enjoyed her class. The topic is obviously hard but she does the best with class Final not mandatory if you do hw assignments/quizzes and project. Alternatively, you can also do none of the hw and only take the final as your grade. Hw are based on lectures., Her presentations were ok, but I just didnt like the fact that if we asked her deeper questions regarding certain topics, she would straight up not know. Other than that, her grading system is weird. Final is worth 100% of your grade, but you can earn up to 30% extra credit. The only thing I liked about the class were the assignments and quizzes., Professor Chen is one of the best CS professors at SJSU. Shes really caring, wants you to do your absolute best, and is very flexible in working with you to succeed. Attending class wasnt mandatory but quiz/exercise passwords are given out during class. 4 Mini Projects and a Group Final project. Final project is graded by prof. and by the class., I think she is too lazy and inexperienced. Assignments are optional as she is too lazy grading them. No clarity in the lectures and slides. She just reads the slides which are copied from other profs. Very long and difficult final exam. You are on your own in terms of learning. Better of with no teacher. Avoid., The workload of this class was manageable compared to other classes I took. The slides were well-formatted and easy to follow and review after class. Prof responded to the email fast and cleared the confusion either in class or make announcements asap. I finished the weekly assignment and a project to get an A without taking a final., The final is literally 100% of the grade and is way too long. Her slides are extremely confusing and it is difficult to understand what she is saying as she talking fast and has a thick accent. Your better off learning off youtube. Lots of extra credit in the form of hw and discussion questions. Definitely would not recommend., Not recommended. No clarity and very confusing grading system., grade is 100% final. quiz/exam are extra credit 1-2points each. Very generous with ec but you have to work for it. turing machine proj can replace final but I was told final was easier. Especially if you did all the quiz. Lectures are excellent and very organized, no need to self study to understand the material. Tricky with mc questions."
Paul Nguyen,/professor/2553649,5.0,100%,2.1,"Great teacher, great material, What a wonderful Professor.  He is responsive to emails and very knowledgeable about cyber security and its issues that go along with that and its procedures., Professor Paul Nguyen is one of the easiest, friendliest, and most helpful teachers I have ever had. Even if you submit a wrong assignment, he will still let you resubmit again without deducting your points. It does not make sense if I do not give him 5 stars for rating and 1 star for difficulty. Thank you for a comfortable and smooth semester., Great professor! Assignments were not difficult and grading criteria is easy to understand. You will get an A if you do the assignments., Class was organized in a way that it made everything super easy. Assignments were not difficult and easy to get an A if you submit your work. Great professor and would take his class again!, Super chill professor who makes getting an A as easy as possible. Group exams and Project account for most of the grade. Only downsides were requiring outdated software like gns3 and mgsoft which do not work well for macs. Also the professor has a thick accent so lectures are sometimes hard to understand., I enrolled in ISDA121 with Professor Nguyen, who is genuinely attentive to his students. During the final project, when someone encountered difficulties, he willingly provided clarification through a video explanation. Additionally, he has been supportive of my career by serving as a reference, and I greatly appreciate it., In my opinion I believe that one of my professors abilities was good teaching style, like the class was sorted out. It was very well organized which matters the most to me., Great Professor! I will take his class again., I would recommend the professor to anyone!, Great professor!, Not a harsh grader and assignments werent that difficult. Just make sure you actually do the work and put in some reading time., Paul Nguyen is a great professor. His class consisted mainly of discussion posts and a couple of exams. The assignments and exams are pretty easy and straightforward if you read the assigned textbook chapters. Hes a fair grader and does not assign unnecessary busy work or long papers. All the assigned work directly relates to the lesson/lecture., Professor Nguyen is great! All the modules were clear to understand and follow along. His class is asynchronous and as long as you manage time to turn assignments in on time you will do just fine., One of the best professors at SJSU info science. Very fair grader and class was straightforward and informative. He also works in the industry so he gave useful information. Great professor to take if you can, Pauls class is quite simple and straightforward. Only 1 midterm, couple of assignments and a final. Very little work is assigned over the semester and examinations are not a surprise, to you. He tells you what to expect and stuff., The class was made up of weekly discussions, a midterm, a final, and some labs/assignments. Professor Nguyen explained how to complete or what is expected in each lab/assignment, so I had no trouble completing them. The topics he chose were helpful in making me learn a lot about cybersecurity policies and practical industry tools., Professor Nguyen is probably one of the easiest professors you can take at SJSU. Our semester only had 4 things (2 midterms, 1 final, and 1 group project), which the professor has gone over multiple times. He also opens up office hours frequently when students need him for assistance., This class is project-oriented. Prof. Nguyen taught us how to use leading network simulation and management software and explains material that is strongly related to the industry. Optionally, you can do Cisco Net Academy to receive a certificate for free. Exams are very straightforward., Professor Nguyen is an exemplary professor and taught one of my favorite classes at SJSU. His assignments were very hands on, which helped me grasp the material better. I gathered a lot of skills that I can apply in the real world in this class, and I have professor Nguyen to thank for that., Professor Nguyen is an amazing, caring, and hilarious professor who answers questions and helps us understand the material. The projects are challenging yet doable, allowing us to apply what weve learned in a practical way. I appreciate his dedication and guidance. I highly recommend taking his class., Extremely nice and caring professor, very practical learning and applications to real life. Highly recommend., Awesome Professor by far one of my best experiences in university. He really teaches valuable and tangent things that you put on your resume and use in real life jobs. Understanding and professional. Helps whenever anyone ask for help. Highly recommended. Other teachers, take notes from him please., Easy class, light on lectures. Overall easy enough to pass, Very informative class on network management. Prof Paul is very knowledgeable in the field so he knows how to lecture the materials. Exams are straight forward from his lectures. Students who found them difficult is because they dont attend classes. If you pay attention to his lectures, then an A is very doable., Professor is straightforward but very detailed and helpful when he teaches the material. He always explains material related to the industry and offers class time to explain any material or homework we may need extra assistance with. Quizzes are open books from CISCO Net Academy, but the material is interesting and relative., One of the best Professor to take if you wanted to learn Network Management. Youll learn a lot from the lab and it wasnt that difficult to understand. He will teach you how to use GNS3 and MIB Browser for the Final project which is pretty easy to do. Overall, great Professor to take! Hella recommend, I feel professor Paul really has passion to teach this course. While his accent make his speaking a little bit hard to understand, he keeps explaining the material until all the people understand it. He also set up a 1 to 1 office hours for any student, who need his help. A really ez going professor, and I do recommend people taking class with him., this professor is great, I hope I can learn all my courses with him, Very cool teacher, he emphasized that hes not here to purposely make the class harder or fail students and that he wants to teach the more practical side of networking. You learn different networking protocols and do hands-on homework and exams. Had 3 exams and 1 final, which are all exactly like the homework so there are no surprises., Great professor. He explained networking well and made it easy to understand with good hands-on practice. He provided good feedback and answered all queries with examples. Take it and you wont regret it., Super cool teacher, 100% recommend him. Empathetic guy who knows what hes talking about., Paul focuses more on the practical side of things. That includes his lectures and tests. Be ready to get your hands dirty throughout the semester as youll be expected more to know how to do something than to know what something is. If you love hands on, then take him! Paul is very caring so though so even if you struggle, hell be there to help., He really cares about his students and helping them get a job. Take him, you wont regret it., Professor Nguyen is overall a respectable lecturer. His classes revolves around Ciscos academy web course with a final project to demonstrate network management. The final project requires you to know industry tools and protocols. It can be group or individual; I did it individually. Expect work for the final project but easygoing for lectures., Chapter lectures and slides were sometimes stale and boring. He makes it up with the labs and final being interesting and fun. He had no problem extending assignments when he saw a lot of us were struggling. He even spent some lectures just answering questions. I had a rough time this semester but he was super nice and understanding., I loved his class! I feel as if I learned a lot more in this class than I would have in another. His style of teaching is way more geared towards real life scenarios rather than textbook hypotheticals. Take him, he is a great professor and you will learn a lot!, Gives good practical homework assignments that give you some exposure to industry tools early on., He is a very kind and warmhearted professor. During COVID19 I had struggled with my assignments and exams but he helps me to learn and he schedule a meeting outside of class time and taught me until I get it right. Thank you professor Nguyen!, During the quarantine, I completely lost control of my classes and fell very behind in his class. However, he was very kind and stayed extra after class and had appointments to help me get back on track. Thank you professor Nguyen!, Very good instructions, clear applicable material to the real world., Good professor in general. Professor Paul is very knowledgeable with networking and therefore he will give you the best knowledge from the industry, plus he also work at Cisco so the stuffs he teaches will be relevant for whoever want to work in the networking field when they graduate. HW and exams are doable. Everyone all receive good grades., Prof Paul Tuan Nguyen is very caring, answers class questions promptly, and creates useful homework assignments that help students learn the protocols much better. Professor does not hesitate to take extra time to help those who ask him. He has a lot of knowledge, and makes sure you only learn things useful to your future. I hope he teaches again!, Professor Paul Tuan Nguyen (not to be confused with the other comp e Prof Paul Nguyen at SJSU) is very practical. With his background in Cisco, he focuses his lectures on practicality rather than theory. At his other college, Ohlone College, he has a rating of 4.9. He cares about his students and is very empathetic. I recommend this professor:)"
Augstin Araya,/professor/222698,3.3,N/A,3.2,"He is one of the most organized professors i have ever met. Very very good teacher, Very good professor. His slides were very clear and clarified all concepts properly. He is not partial and does fair grading., dont ever take his class. partial and discourage weak & his non-favorite students. he creates a barrier between good and bad students and he also has list of his fav. and non-fav. students. no curving nothing..thats all ****., Good prof with corny jokes.  Explains things pretty well and really knowledgeable about OS.  Make sure you select hard working ppl for your semester project or youll be screwed.  Exams are hard but he curves like hell., He has a strong accent. His program assignments are long but doable. His exams are long and hard but he curves big time. If you attend class regularly, read the book and study youll do just fine., Cons: His notes are badly organized but the notes are very important for midterm and final. Pros: Professor Araya is enthusiastic about this subject, he is very willing to help, he has a sense of humor - he resembles The World Most Interesting Man.  To Do Well make sure you study the final review questions and midterm review questions.  Good Luck, Very Good that\s the only words I understand him. He has a very thick Spanish accent. His class is boring and not very useful. Not recommended., He\s teaching style is not that effective and not very helpful in office hours. He\s an ok teacher if you may. If you have some experience programming and you participate you should be ok., Teaching, sometimes makes you feel little boring. But once you get into project and observe the real world UI designs, you would start appreciating the course. Responds back to questions and suggests well., A lot of busy work, teaching concepts that are obsolete. Vague directions regarding assignments. No response to inquiries to clarify the assignment. Team based assignments throughout the duration of the term. Panalising grading policy. Penalizes students for being bad test takers, or for have lazy group members., not organized, gets lost in his own presentation at times. make sure he knows u by name, else all ur hard work is just a waste of time. answer his questions even if ur answer is not connected to the question he asked. his project involves lots of redundant work., If you take his class, make sure to start the semester in a group of hard working students, otherwise, the semester long group project will screw you up. Nice, helpful professor, sometimes vague on project insturctions, very long hw and tests., Projects are not as difficult as long and time consuming. His exams are doable., His exams are doable, just study the lecture notes. Tends to skim quickly over some subjects, tho. Projects are VERY long, and generate some questions because of their wording, some of which dont get answered and you have to guess. He is a nice guy (some cheezy jokes)..so overall the class is ok. I could see why some would choose Horstmann, tho., His lectures are very boring, maybe its due to my lack of interest in the subject but everyone seemed bored too. Assignments are unclear plus has group work, which sucks if you have group members whom are lazy. Nice guy but doesnt seem interested in teaching and his lectures shows it. I wouldnt take him again, You can take his cs151, but never take his cs160. His exams and projects are very long and difficult. you will become a crazy man or woman., I had him for object oriented design. At firs the accent is thick, but by the second class youll be able to hear what he is saying with no problem. I learned quite a bit in his class, and I am a better programmer because of it. Definitely take any class he teaches, you wont be disappointed., what is wrong with this guy? he thinks that his class is the only one we have.  Homework is too unclear, and his accent makes it really hard to understand, you would think that a teacher that asks so much from his students would at least make an effort to learn proper english. save yourself the pain and bad grade, take someone else., poor instructor, with a terrible accent, I spent a of time trying to understand what he is saying in the class.  I wish I never took his class, Dr. Araya was tres cool. Theres not a single thing wrong with the way this man teaches. Easy A if you know what youre doing when it comes to programming., his exams are very hard...very long projects and assignments which consume a lot of time leaving you with only a few hours if you are taking other subjects, Take him for 151. You will become a better programmer, and will learn alot that you can apply. His assignments are long, but very doable. It is true that his exams are long and difficult, but with the curve, the average can be close to 80%., nice man, tries to help students, reminds me of an eastern version of tom cruise, but very very very hard. exams will drive you insane!!, He is a really bad teacher, with a terrible accent, I spent most of the time trying to understand what he is saying, but I guess thats the case with most of the computer science teachers at SJSU, his assingments are too hard and unclear.  Save yourself the F and dont take this teacher., Way too much work for the homework, it only counts as 20-30 percent of your grade but you spend most of your time doing it, its only a 3 unit class so homework is not proportional. Has a really thick accent so is really hard to understand, needs to improve his english.  Homework is never clear., Poor instructor. Never in office hours. Never responds to emails. Programming assignments have too many contradictions, almost like he doesn\t know how to program. Some lectures begin with what would you like to know today.. Always gotten A\s but sensing a poor grade from him. don\t take. Nice guy, He only uses his test case to test your programs, so some people cheat on their programs. He not really know program well. I think he is suck at writing a program. Even he knows, but he will take a long time. He need upgrade himself.COME ON CS., He is hard in cs160. if your group has 2 persons, try to work hard. his projects and final exam will kill you., very friendly person, considerate. knows his subject well . assignments are well thought of and graded liniently and fairly . exams dont kill you. youll learn from this course ., excellent knowledge. great handouts. challenging assignments that dont kill you. considerate and kind man . you learn a lot from him and never feel humiliated . start his homework on time though...like i said it is challenging ., nice man, clear lecture, easy on the grade, Very well organized.  Sometimes a little vague and sometimes too clear (helping with programs =)).  Over all good teacher, Great teacher, very organized, has his own style of teaching which requires students to adjust. Wonderfully kind and understanding, supports students 100%, listens to students carefully which is a rare feature in this dept., Assignments are hard. But he is a verynice instructor. Will explain you and help you work through the problems., One of the better CS teachers at SJSU.  He will help you if you dont understand the material very well and not belittle you like other professors.  Work is graded generously but takes a long time to do.  Make sure you start the programs early!, I thought the overheads were clear and his lectures were informative.  You can learn a lot, if you put in the effort,  that will help you throughout the rest of  your programming classes. Start his programs right away!, Goes through overhead very quickly. Assignments are harder than average but not too bad. Tests are hard, too. But gives a lot of good grades in the end. I would recommend him., Hard to take notes in his class sometimes because he just goes through overheads. Prog. assignments are pretty long, but he gives you plenty of time to do them and helps you along the way. Tests are also long, but are graded easy as with the hw., Tests have hard questions, but are graded very leniently. Homework is ridiculously long, sometimes very hard (graded easy) ... will gain a lot of experience simply surviving this class ..."
Nada Attar,/professor/2445092,2.4,34%,3.4,"If you can afford to wait another semester to graduate then take this class if not then look for another professor, Professor was very helpful and thorough in her lectures, always willing to help out when asked and gave great in class exercises that helped us excel in the exams., If you can take another DSA class, you should because the lectures, homework, quizzes, and exams are not related or helpful. I hope that I didnt take her class. Her lectures are not relevant to what will be tested., Extremely poor teacher, does not teach you how to apply concepts and does not seem to fully understand topics that she is teaching. Despite previous reviews claiming a caring experience I wish that I did not take this class as this was far from my experience. Take any other section unless you are fine with learning everything from YouTube, You learn more and understand better just by google search or from one of those DSA websites.\nFor homework, she will sometime just throw you a coding question and youre on your own.\nFor exams, wording are confusing that you might miss some free questions.\nHer lecture are slight useful in exams but not so much on homework. Quizzes are fairly easy., Worst professor in the whole CS department. She doesnt even know the concepts.\nDont take her even if you delay your graduation., You will spend more time trying to understand what a problem is asking than solving them., Take literally any other section. She turns concepts that could be explained in ~20 minutes into a 1 hour and 15 minute meandering that will leave you more confused than when you started. Homework and exams are riddled with confusing language and incomplete info. Completely theory focused, you will not be taught how to code anything that is covered, Professor is nice but lectures can be confusing. HW and exams are very difficult. Problems can take a while to solve because of the difficulty. Beware to never contact her through email, she never replied back regarding my final grade. Go to her office hours if you need anything., You wont understand anything in class, rely on Youtube university. Useless lectures, not at all helpful for you to understand the DSA concepts. Harsh grades, losing one mark in exam is like losing 1 percent. Dont take this course with this professor. Despite of bad reviews in RMP, I made the biggest mistake to take this with her., Plenty of homework. Lectures were sometimes unclear. Exams were tough but if you do the readings (not required) and rewatch lectures, it will help a lot, Nada is a good professor. She cares about her student and takes feedback very seriously. Her lectures are confusing sometimes and some hw are difficult, Dr. Attar is a very nice and patient professor. She tries her best to help the students learn. However, at times she gets the facts wrong during lectures. Homework could expect you to know more than what was covered in the lecture. Tests also can get tougher than the material covered but she curves them. Go to office hours, work hard, and practice!, She does not care about the students and the whole class is not transparent. You cant see what you did wrong for the final, so basically, you have to accept whatever she gives you on the final. She already had 1 question wrongly graded for my exam1. So you never know if she makes a mistake on the final as well., She explains topics clearly and her slides are straightforward. But HW is much harder than lecture examples, OH only somewhat helps, and tests are easy. This class isnt difficult, you can get an A in this class rather easily. But I wouldnt say I left this class feeling confident about CS 146, so if youre in it for the grade, go for it I guess., Nada is a great professor. Good lectures and she prepares you well for the exams. She is very kind and wants to help you succeed. She takes feedback from students and improves her class in real time. Ive really enjoyed her class and would gladly take more from her in the future., Nada is kind of a nice instructor, but her class structure was bad. Her lecture slides are unprofessional, and the hw does not prep well for quizzes. It was ridiculous to make quizzes 40% and homework 30%. If you do bad on one quiz or more. The more difficulty to be able to pass the class. She kind of frustrated me., Like other reviews, Nada didnt do good as a teacher but partly cuz it was asynchronous and she didnt communicate back to us clearly. Most times ur better off self-learning, lectures usually didnt explain well. Tests had some surprises. Took weeks to grade. Tho I will say the tests and hws are not that hard if you understand the material., She doesnt really teach the subject well and you really need to know this stuff in the future., Professor Attar is not good at teaching. She does not seem to prepare for the class or understand the material or care - most explanations seems memorized or read off a slide. Office hours are useless. I am not sure why she is assigned to teach these key courses. Do avoid her classes., Ive never left a review before, but professor Attar was so bad that I felt I needed to warn anyone that might take her in the future. She didnt seem to know the material well, her quizzes/homeworks were often on topics not covered in class or the textbook, very harsh grading, took over a month to grade stuff, and not helpful during office hours., Absolute garbage class., Absolutely terrible experience with the professor. The lectures fell behind my an entire month leaving us with no time to study. She also changed the format of exam halfway through because she suspected some students were cheating disregarding syllabus. Homework and projects were meaningless for the final as questions were completely different, Its my first time writing a bad review. Attar is the most terrible prof I have ever known. She doesnt prepare her lectures in advance. Her office hours arent helpful cuz she doesnt know the materials well. We fall behind the syllabus like 2-3 weeks after the 1st midterm. She doesnt stick with the syllabus nor explain why., Not very responsive. Dont expect replies back until 2 weeks later or never at all(in my case). Other than that, easy A class. I didnt watch any of her lectures but still managed an A the whole time. Better off watching youtube videos on the content because her lecture videos are her reading off of Princeton slides., Most Professors at SJSU are either neutral or good. Attar is absolute trash (at least for CS146) and she has no idea about the concepts she is teaching. Most of the time, I learned through the online Coursera course taught by the Princeton Professors who wrote Algorithms 4th edition. Also, she said the test is Open note and said students cheated xd, Projects and hw assignments did not prepare you for the exam. Lectures also dont help as she just reads from the slides and isnt that engaged with the material. Apart from this she takes forever to grade material and releases the midterm study guides at the last minutes. Exams may have questions beyond the scope of the class., Projects and hw assignments were fun and all until I realized they do not prepare you for the exam. A one question quiz brought my grade down almost 15%. Exams have lockdown browser although it is open note, and you cannot go back to see the previous question. You can stay on top of everything and still fear not passing the class., As a transfer and I was afraid CS courses here would be tough and exhausting, but Professor Attar taught at a really good pace. Shes caring and tries to do live sessions so students can interact even though the class is asynchronous. Only downside is that sometimes she makes mistakes on things. Lenient grader and fairly easy tests, would recommend, Professor Nattar is super nice and caring of students but her class is definitely disorganized. Very few assignments compared to the other CS146 professors from what Ive heard which can be good or bad depending on how much you invest outside of the lectures. Wouldnt recommend if youre not motivated to learn data structures on your own., Professor Nada is one of the most sweetest professor Ive had; shes always willing to help you in need (go to her office hours) and shell explain it if you dont understand in lecture :D. Very nice and down to earth person, Professor Nada was one of the most genuine and nicest professors Ive had so far. I think the reason most people did not enjoy her class was because the lectures were not as engaging as compared to CS46A. However, her class was extremely straight forward in terms of the materials we learned and I can definitely say she did a great job. Very kind!, Its very easy to lose interest in lectures but slides are online so you can go through them again. Do all your homework because thats a huge portion of your grade and extra credit really helps. You need to create a huge buffer because the study guide didnt help much on what the final contains. Main point: Do all homework and do well on midterms, The professor isnt that bad if you are able to grasp the concepts in her lecture. However, sometimes, lectures are overly stretched sometimes only briefly touched. Homework is important. The final was rather more difficult than what was provided on the study guide, so better give yourself a buffer (do well in 8 HWs and the 2 midterms)., Please take this class when offered by a different professor. Nada does not seem to understand the material she is teaching. The lectures are long and tedious when a google search reveals a simpler more elegant explanation. Her lectures are monotonous and seems memorized., If youre signed up to take a class with Nada, withdraw now and find a different teacher. First of all she is quieter than a newborn mouse, and has mic issues every class. Second her way of teaching ideas is extremely dragged out and unnecessary. Her homework assignment explanations are very confusing. And to top it off our midterm was on paper., She does not even consider situations of people and her grading is arbitrary. She does not have a clear explanation of her grading scheme., Lecture are very clear . Easy A if you attend her classes and do all the assignments (4 to 5 assignments). She is very friendly and makes effort to clear students doubts., Shes a very cool professor with a a dark sense of humor. Her class in general is pretty chill and shes very passionate in what she does. It was her first time lecturing at my university and for her first semester she did an exceptional job."
Kaushik Patra,/professor/1977127,2.3,29%,4.3,"I had to take CS147, and he was the only option. His lectures are boring and very outdated. He gives you labs and projects, and you have to rely on his slides and lectures to complete those. I struggled with them because his teaching methods are one of the worst Ive seen. It feels that rather than teaching, hes here to collect his paycheck., One of the most incompetent professors I have ever had. Hes not good at giving lectures and has a flipped classroom style of teaching, so you have to watch every lecture before class. Has very specific requirements for labs but never mentions them unless he is asked directly. Will mark you for a zero unless you follow said requirements., Hes not that good at giving lectures and most lectures are student-led for extra credit. Exams can be pretty confusing. However, he makes it pretty easy to pass the class considering the extra credit opportunities and the quizzes / assignments weighing more than the midterm and final., Patra has a flipped class format where you watch the lectures (recorded years ago & questionable quality) before you attend the class, where the same info is regurgitated by students teaching for extra credit. 90% of classes were student-led because Patra is lazy. He was a terrible teacher and I didnt learn but at least he was generous with EC., The material in this class is different. To succeed, you need to stay ahead of the lecture material in class through videos. Hes really helpful in office hours if youre ever confused, most people dont go and get behind the class lecture. Take good notes & stay ahead of video lectures to get an A. If you fall behind (me), youre toast., Reuses a lot of content so a lot is searchable online. The old recorded lectures arent that great. Show up to designated lecture time for random pop quizzes. Memorize mcqs and study frqs for exams. 1 cheat sheet(front/back) for midterm, 2 for final. The professor knows his stuff, but the content itself can be confusing with his style of teaching., You need to watch videos before each lecture to understand. Sometimes these videos can be over an hour long. As a commuter student, it became almost impossible to stay on top of what was going on. Start the final project early or you will regret it. The best thing about this class was the bonus points you could earn to save your grade., The way the course is structured, you watch the lecture videos for homework and he reviews the material during lecture. He explains the topics very slowly but, it is also thorough so it is ok. If you are on top of the lecture videos and complete the programming assignments, you should be good., flipped lecture style. tells you to watch the material before coming to class, and as material gets more difficult throughout the semester, it becomes difficult. If he went over the material and the examples in lecture, it would be easier for students to understand. Class is not impossible, long as you do everything with the extra credit, Material ramps up in difficulty after the first half, and the flipped lecture style personally was not very helpful to me. Theres a few coding assignments, quizzes, and pop quizzes (extra credit), but as other reviews say the final project is the most time consuming part of this class. Reuses some questions from quizzes on the finals, best of luck, Give out a lot of extra credits, you will get an A if you spend time learning the materials and put efforts to get tons of extra credits he gave, In terms of grades, this class is a very easy A+ class. You will basically automatically get a curve of 5% in the class from bonus points. Even if you arent doing well there is extra credit on the project to further boost your grade. The quality of the videos he provides are not superb, but test questions will almost always be in the videos., Way worse than his 47. 3 projects in Verilog, not enough material to prep for that imo. Midterm and Final are based on quiz questions. This class was 3 units, but it felt like 5 units in all honesty., The subject itself is difficult, and at times his teaching style is questionable. However, theres a lot of extra credit through pop quizzes and participation. 6 quizzes with 2 attempts, midterm and final that are made up of questions from past quizzes, and a project that is actually straightforward IMO, but time-consuming., Incredibly difficult class and the hardest Ive ever taken being a 3rd year CS uni student. DONT PROCRASTINATE ON HIS HOMEWORK. You need every minute. There are a total of 3. Make sure youre comfortable in Verilog or youre screwed. Really nice, caring guy and obviously fully understand this material. It really shows in his explanations & lecture, This teacher singlehanded made me want to switch majors. He pre-records all of his lectures and expects you to watch them BEFORE scheduled class time. Not only do you have to watch the recorded lecture, you also have to sit through his regular class session, which ends up doubling the time spent in lectures. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!, Please avoid if possible, this class is a headache., Heres what you need to know: 1) attendance is mandatory, 2) quizzes and tests are hard, 3) the project will carry your grade, especially if you do the extra credit component of it, 4) he also gives out extra points at the end (based on participation / how much you tried). Not a hard class, just material is poorly explained by confusing style., The professor clearly knows his material well, but in teaching it, its kinda hard for us students to grasps (in terms of concept). Although midterm is probably where many messed up, doing the project well (start early or else) and the final was very lenient. He was also very generous in giving extra points that help boost grades at end of semester, He is not very helpful or approachable. I think he does not like when students ask him for help because it forces him to acknowledge that he is not good at teaching. He simply points to the same diagrams over and over again... Very ineffective, he makes the topic way harder than it has to be., he makes the topic way harder than it has to be by explaining in strange ways, also he is not very helpful. I cant believe they let teachers like this teach at SJSU, he makes everything so stressful, Honestly, he really discourage me to study the course and I have no passion to study the CS147 with him. I prefer to fall his class and take with another professor. Ffs., This is the kind of professor that makes you change your major. His projects and exams are brutal. This class is basically two classes in one. His lectures about hardware require you to watch his lectures online, and the Verilog projects which are worth half your grade arent covered at all in class. Take someone else if you can., Dont take him., Would not recommend. Expect to waste half your day watching his videos WHILE having other classes to worry about. (Fun fact: some of his videos are longer than lecture time!) You need to have some knowledge in the field or else youre lost. Studied a week and went to office hours and still had no idea what to do on midterm. Great guy, bad teacher., He just makes you watch an hour long video each day instead of lecturing in class and whenever you ask him a question, he tells you to look at your notes instead of explaining the concepts. Videos are very boring to watch, no engagement at all. Also, assumes you have a lot of previous knowledge about hardware, making you get lost very quickly., One of the worst classes/teachers Ive ever had. A lot of the questions on his quizzes do NOT reflect things you have learned from the lecture slides/his class and its hard to even find the information online so you can actually understand the question. This class is required so we have to take it but honestly one of my worst experiences ever, One of the hardest classes I ever took. The labs he assigned were incredibly difficult and takes a lot of time. The reviews he gave us for tests were huge and did not help at all. The questions did not pertain to the review at all., A lot of people on here really harpoon on Patra,but hes actually a pretty chill and funny professor, though he does have an accent. He assigns one big project at the end of the semester that is quite time consuming, so make sure you start early. It isnt super hard, but many start too late and complain later that its too hard or there is no time., You have to take his course since he is the only instructor you can choose for CS47. Good luck. I feel K Patra CS47 is MUCH HARDER than David Tylor CS146., As some other people may have mentioned, the hardest thing I struggled with is how abstract the class is. It is a difficult course. Go to office hours when you feel like you dont understand something. Start on the homework and project early too (they boost your grade a lot). You may get low scores but Patra is generous with curves., Patra is an extremely nice dude. My issue is that he cant really close to gap between having the knowledge of the material and being able to teach it to students in an easy manner. I HIGHLY!!! advise you to go to office hours and sit up front. Attendance is taken, he curves very generously, and the material itself is quite different from other CS., Eh pretty decent professor. 2 HW, 1 MT, 1 Project and the final. HWs give you a fair idea of the finals and MT. Project is tough. hes ok, Difficulty through the roof, Patra was a genuinely a really good professor. He clearly understands the material very well. He answers questions well, and is especially helpful in office hours. The project is difficult, so start early. The final is actually ridiculous, while we havent gotten our grades, everyone I talked to thought they had failed it., Took him for CS47 too, this review is for 147. This is a very difficult class, and you will learn a lot. He is a great teacher and knows his stuff inside and out. Youll be fine if you go to class often and stay on the same page as him. Ask questions if youre unsure, otherwise youll be really really lost. Overall hard class but good teacher, Patra will challenge you but you will learn. The homeworks and projects (especially the projects) are very difficult but if you can suffer through them, you will have a deep understanding of the material that you couldnt possibly get by just listening to / reading the lectures. You cant put off projects to the last minute in this class!!, As long as you read the online lectures before coming to class as well as reviewing after, you should understand the materials well. 2 homework (20%), 8 programming assignments (10%), 20% project which should be doable as long as you follow his guidelines. 1 midterm (20%) and 1 final (30%, great curve). He offered extra credit in the final"
Thaddeus Aid,/professor/2132848,4.4,85%,2.9,"1 of my most fav classes ever. For a dry subject, I ended up enjoying the topic and learned a lot. Very accessible & provides advice about the industry/jobs. He also includes diversity in his lectures, so you learn about more than just computability. Not a hard class when you attend the lectures - he explains things very well., CS154 is a boring yet important class and Thaddeus even admits that. He teaches the class like its your friend teaching you. Tends to ramble on into tangents during lecture, but is willing to go to any extent to help you outside of class. Gave clear summaries of what to expect on exams. Gave a take home final and a class pizza/movie night instead!, Thaddeus is a really good professor and a great person. He goes off topic during lectures, but his tangents are also something interesting to learn from as well. Easy grader, and homework is lighter than other Computer Science classes. Hes really passionate about teaching his students. He cares a lot about what he does and shows it., Its not easy to find a professor who is relate-able to students, but Thaddeus is down to earth and chill (he games you can add him on Steam). I had to commute a lot for my classes at another school and he was very understanding.   Content is mostly theory based with a coding project at the end. We go over complexity theory which is interesting, He is a nice person, although I dont really like his teaching style. CS154 is a hard class to teach and according to what I heard from other sections, this is your best choice. Although you should still learn the most part by yourself., Awesome teacher Gave us pizza.. Lectures off topic sometimes but its still interesting. Would take again., Professor Aid is very passionate about CS and teaches his life experiences to become successful in the field. He is up to date with current technologies and motivates his students to be excited in CS. Take Aid for CS 154 at all costs because the difference of professor Aid or professor Taylor is whether you will pass or fail. I know by experience., First professor to be understanding of what being a student is like. Lectures pair with the homework/test, so its helpful to pay attention. Straight forward grader.  Connects alot of what we do in class to the real world and tried to make sure everyone understands what is being taught., Professor Aid is an awesome professor. He is passionate for technology and it shows. Every class will begin with a tangent about current technology or how to improve your career as a computer scientist. All of his assignments are essay based and attending lecture is mandatory if you want to have an easy time otherwise start googling!, Professor Aid is clearly passionate about Computer Science, and his passion and interest for all things tech and science shines through and makes his lectures genuinely enjoyable. Highly recommended., He is a great Prof. I love what he teaches. Assignments are little hard, but You will learn a lot from them. Midterm and Final are straightforward to what he mentions., Took CS 152 over the summer.  Essay heavy - 1500 words for some, 3000 for others, not impossible, not a strict minimum more of a guideline.  If you can communicate the concepts succinctly in less thats fine unless youre going for a max grade perfect A.  Tests depend on your class - he lets you have a say in their design/difficulty.  Solid choice., Very laid back dude. He does a surprising amount of papers for a CS class, so I hope you like writing. His grading is pretty lax, and if you put in some effort its fairly easy to get a B or C on the hw or midterm., Cool guy, in touch with stuff. Into nerd communities. Grades hard on essays, easy on tests. Will usually grant extensions if class asks. Asks class for input on what should be graded/judged on finals or taken into account on papers. Fun dude., Very cool professors, tests are hard but he gives you option to redo for half points., A really good Professor.  The assignments are pretty straightforward.  Would definitely recommend him., Gives you chocolate if he doesnt grade your assignment on time, major plus., We had one long Saturday afternoon class, and hell usually go through 3-4 slide decks a class so its very information heavy. Hes very generous with midterms, provided you know the topic well. For homework, be prepared to do a lot of outside research because the specs are broad. Just give him honest feedback on how he teaches and youll do good., I am a visual learner, so I hope that he could do more on the whiteboard. Although the lecture is really hard to understand, he tried his best to get his students to learn. His grading is super fair. He understood that everyone struggled, so more points were given if you showed him that you worked hard in class., Profesor Aid is a high energy teacher that is very approachable and tells great stories."
Katerina Potika,/professor/2099184,3.4,50%,3.4,"Really lecture focused, takes participation with pollev and class is kind of boring. Homework assignments that are confusing/already coded for you? Not a huge fan of her but the class is doable, only recommend if you have a heavy interest. Shes a nice enough person, just not a great teacher imo., Dr. Potika is friendly and caring. I would say out of the 146 professors(I took this course when she taught it, not this sem) I felt that she cared about us and wanted us to learn the material. Take her if you want to both learn and feel like youre supported - which these things are critical in a difficult course like CS 146., Potika is one of the few professor I would like to sit down and have a coffee with. Shes very passionate about Social Networks and her passion can be felt. She can crack a few good jokes as well. My only criticism would be her power points are not very thorough., Take this professor/class combo if you dont want to learn anything and get an easy A+. Most confusing teacher I had throughout college. Was not interested in teaching the class, constantly changed rubrics, extremely disorganized., You could kinda tell Potika wasnt crazy passionate about teaching this class, but I cant blame her given everythings online. Super nice albeit a tad disorganized at times (but again, cant blame her too much). Take full advantage of the cheat sheet(s) she allows on exams: Im talking 7 pt font and fitting every detail of her PPT slides on there., 4 projects which werent horrible as long as you start early; you just apply algorithms you learned in class. Midterm and final were fairly difficult so study extra hard. There is a participation grade, so make sure you ask questions in lecture or on Piazza. Subject itself is difficult even if you take with other professors, so self study a lot., With the semester coming to an end(1 week left). She gave us a project due before the final. Did she expect us to not study for the final and just worry about the project? Her lecture is very rush, she speed through many concept and expect us to understand it by the next lecture. Most of the time she will only explain half the class example., She is by far the weirdest yet to say the most ridiculous professor I have ever taken. She makes everything so complicated for her students. Her lectures are not intuitive, canvas is such a mess. I cant understand her teaching style to be honest. Yet, I would still have to try to pass this class. Meh..., Sweet and caring prof overall. Lectures are meh and disorganized and she went thru some material too fast. Projects are long and time-consuming so start early. Project instructions are unclear and confusing so get clarification asap. Weird and inconsistent grading on projects (esp. the 1st one). Expect some typos and incorrect answers on quizzes., Potikas a very sweet professor. She gives detailed lectures thatre fun, but also break down the concepts in clear, succinct ways. Exams are based off past ones. Projects are time consuming, but worth the trouble. Do the HW (even if not graded), study the old exams, and youll be able to succeed in this course., By far the least rigorous professor for 146. Exams are very similar to previous ones she gives. Programming assignments(3-4) arent too bad and dont change too often during semesters. Pay attention in class and do the hw and make sure you know the practice exams really well. Averages were pretty high (78, a B- with her grading scale) 65 for a C-, Easily one of the best 146 instructors at SJSU. Pretty good lectures that are worth your time, a lot of the test questions are pulled directly from lecture slides. 2 Midterms, 1 Final, 4 Projects. Exams were more than fair and projects were challenging but doable. I would highly recommend her., Unorganized way of teaching. Assignment schedule was so unorganized that we had assignments due until the final exam date. Lectures were confusing. Professor never replies to emails. She takes too long to grade homework that one forgets what the homework was about. Do not expect any help with selecting project topic or project related queries., Potika is a really sweet professor. Shes pretty funny too and shes willing to help anyone who needs it. The class itself isnt bad, the homework isnt graded, and attendance isnt required. Potika will explain concepts very well and I recommend taking her. The exams itself are pretty fair, but they do test if you really understand the topics., Easy class. Hilarious Professor. Good teacher. Clear grading criteria. One of my favorite professors at San Jose State., She is kind in grading tests and assignments, Her lectures are amazing, CS 146 is a pretty difficult class with anyone, but her lectures help you in understanding the conceptual stuff more easily. Her projects took hella long so start that stuff early. Optional hw is optional (doesnt hurt to try some of them). Exams are notoriously bad in every CS 146 class, its just less so here so study pseudocode and concepts., Shes alright. Lectures are not as structured and clear as you might expect them from a college professor, but as long as you are focused during class you have a good chance of passing. Definitely not an easy A, but compared to Taylor you have to work less to pass, but might not learn as much. Probably wouldnt take her again., Unorganized way of teaching and confusing lectures. I would prefer to take professor Lin over her. Doesnt grade homework, doesnt  even check them. Dont expect any help in your projects."
Walter Kirchherr,/professor/100287,3.2,N/A,3.7,"This teacher expects waaaaaaaaaaaay too much. Not only do you not know what you are getting throughout the semester, he just murmurs throughout the whole time. I had to take a class, and this was the only one that would fit in my schedule. Avoid at ALL costs. He was okay as far as CS140, There is no book for this class, just online notes, so you save money. Notes and lectures are clear and easy to understand. Lectures are boring, you can skip them and read the online notes. Do the homework, read the notes, and youll learn a lot and will be prepared for the tests.  I got docked for stupid mistakes, watch out for those in assembly!, Very boring lecturer. Hand writing are so small and so hard to read. Test are really hard. You learn mostly assembly language in this class, Not alot of C. Never saw him smile,not even once even when he throws a joke he just grin a little..very boring guy., Tough on grading assignments, but clear and reasonable overall.  Be darned sure youre OK on discrete math beforehand--youll need it.  Also, hes one of the few profs in the department that tightly enforces prereqs--make sure youve done a transfer equivalency with Rocio Avila beforehand if youre a transfer student!, Lectures are a little dry but are very helpful in the overall nature of the course. Homework is right from the lecture notes, which is also the course textbook for the class.\n \n 3 assembly programs and 2 C programs. Grading is fairly leniant for both homework and tests. Would take again in the future., Make sure you sit in the FRONT seat. Or you will have a hard time reading his handwriting. Also, you must do your projects PERFECTLY, or the grader(not the instructor) will take off a lot of points as he like. I do not recommend taking this teacher unless youre sure that youre a GOOD programmer., Thought he was great.  Always started lecture with mini-review of previous one - very helpful.  Consistent in notation and presentation.  Seemed to have deep knowledge of the subject.  Tests were *hard*, but curved generously.  Was not very flexible, but willing to correct mistakes.  Writes *very* fast - tough to keep up. Would take again., I got an A, but it wasnt easy. His lectures can be long and boring, but they are vital in order to succeed in his class. Overall, he is a nice guy, but he can be a pretty tough grader. Small mistakes on an exam or assignment can cost you a few percent. Follow instructions and dont procrastinate on the projects and you will do fine., Follow his directions extremely close. I did an assignment that required color change, but because my color didn\t *fade* as he showed in his example, he took 40% off!, He was not very enthusiastic about the material and never related the material to real life examples. Boring lecturer., This guy might have some knowledge about the subject he teaches, but he definitely show no interest of sharing it with the students. Very crapy teacher!  Try some other professors, because you not going to learn anything in his class!!!, Do not take him for upper division courses. His programming knowledge is limited. he doesnt know much about computers. Every class just reads the book out loud and demands memorization of the entire book (pictures, entire javadoc hierarchy). Wont give you any info besides reading the book in class, Very good lecturer.  Is well prepared and tests are fair.  No book for the class because all the material is on his website which is great.  Gives good explainations and answers questions.  The best professor in CS so far., do not take his class if you can avoid it, Excellent communicator.  No suprises on tests. Having taken other Profs for this class found him a relief.  Good technique for teaching material., has a wide and deep pool of knowledge.  take him if you get a chance -- you are bound to learn something., Excellent lecturer, tends to be very methodical and goes at a slower pace.Tests were straight forware except for his thought questions which were a bit twisted.You can get an A from him as he curves.He is also approachable about questions and, What a jerk for giving Fs for anyone who doesnt have an average of 75% or higher on the 2 midterms and final.  He doesnt care..his class is survival of the fittest!, Good lecturer, clearly states what is covered in the class. A good background in Discrete Math really helps. Tests are a little tricky, but he curves."
Yulia Newton,/professor/2599405,4.7,95%,1.8,"Take her if you can. Thats all Ill say. Light work. Easiest CS class imo., Awesome professor and an easy class. You use existing libraries like sklearn instead of coding AI algorithms from scratch. Homework isnt hard at all as she provides many helpful code examples. Actually encourages you to use Google if youre not sure how to code something. Yulia was always willing to stay after class to answer any questions I had., Class is super easy. Attendance is not mandatory. Quizzes, midterm, and final are all open note. Homework isnt too bad, theres just a lot., Yulia Newton is the Greatest Of All Time, I highly recommend taking her classes, you will learn a lot. She answers all of your questions and cares about her students., One of the best CS professors at SJSU. She posts all homework assignments during the start of the semester so we can finish them all up early if we want. Responds fast to emails. Exams are fairly easy and open book. A few quizzes posted after some classes that we can take on our own time. Very caring and patient professor., She is one of the best CS Professors at SJSU. I wished I took some other classes with her too. I am very thankful for taking her as our project advisor for the Software Engineering Senior Design project. If you have a chance to take her for your required or elective classes, take her!, Great professor, her classes are pretty easy so its an easy A. Shes a very popular choice because of this. I would say if u learn better by being challenged then choose a diff professor. Otherwise, pick this prof for a chill time! (~8 Quizzes, 5 HWs, 2 Midterms, 1 Final), This semester hasnt ended yet. But I really love, love this professor. She is the most patient, logical, thoughtful and nice professor I have ever met in SJSU. As a student mom with two kids, time is always limited. She went out of her way to set up extra office hour with me and helped with the unclear parts I had. Cant appreciate more., Professor Newton is one of the best teachers Ive taken. Clear grading criteria with not many assignments given. She posts the whole semesters homework at the beginning of the semester so you can get it all done early if you want. Exams are open note and contain multiple choice and a few short answer questions. Very helpful and patient teacher., The professor is easy, perhaps too easy. If you would like to coast through one of the most industry-relevant class, do take it and get an easy A. Yeah, you will get the A, but you wont really learn anything (wont learn much beyond a very surface understanding)., The BEST in the business period. the easiest A+ you can ever ask for. and the best part is she teaches like really freakin well. So, its a win-win for students. quizzes, exams, final everything is open all day to take at anytime. literally the most chill prof on campus. you have to take her atleast once if youre a CS major. worth every cent!, Best CS professor at SJSU. She gives you maximum flexibility with online exams and finals (even for in-person classes). Always take her if you can!, The only downside is how easy this class was. It was hard to motivate myself to learn when I knew in the back of my head that the final could be taken with 20 minutes of skimming notes. That said, you get what you put into the class since you have the freedom to choose your final projects topic., Incredible teacher. The only downside is that her lectures a little dry but she covers the material very thoroughly as its very hard. Homework and quizzes are short and very straightforward (she gives you existing code references too!) midterm/final open notes. Shes very friendly in office hours too., Prof. Newton is amazing! Super caring and acknowledges that a lot of coding is just googling how things work. Took her for CS 151 & CS 156. All quizzes, tests, and homework are open book, open note, open internet, just dont cheat with your friends. If you put in the small amount of work required, you will get an A. I slacked off and still got a B!, Midterm and final were open-note, so they werent that bad. Plus you get a whole day to work on them. Quizzes after each lecture module, which are also open-note and get unlimited time to do them until the due date. HW takes around 1 to 3 hours to do, but theyre not mentally tasking. Would definitely recommend!, Probably the only CS prof that has good communication w students. Her quizzes are all based off her slides. If you do the assignments and quizzes, the exam is a breeze. She is a fair grader and is always free to discuss any questions or issues. Prof Newton is angel sent down from heaven., Amazing professor. Was always ready to help even outside of office hours. Makes class easy., Prof. Newton is new to teaching, so her lectures can be dreary; on the bright side, her slides are very thorough, so you can understand the topics just by reading them. Tests, quizzes, and even exams are open notes and open Internet, so theyre easy enough. I recommend actually putting in effort into the homework, as it helped me grasp concepts."
Kevin Smith,/professor/2285135,4.2,77%,3.2,"Nice human being, professor Smith is really knowledgeable in gaming industry. Class was project heavy, all projects/labs were take home, giving enough time. However, if you dont know C++, this class can prove troublesome for you. Some projects gave lot of stress, but key was to start early., Project heavy with elementary C++ and 3D modeling (can solo or duo). By far, one of the easier upper div CS courses, and its a lot of fun. Literally just follow rubric requirements & youll get an A; hes a lenient grader & understanding. Everything is take-home & provides starter code. Attendance isnt necessary if you can reverse engineer code., C++ heavy class, no exams, only coding projects. Clear lectures, you need to know a little basic calculus and physics. The professor is very kind, attend his office hours if you need help. You complete labs that lead up to a 2D game and a 3D game. If you have the time, definitely take it, it is my favorite CS elective at SJSU!, Best to have a basic foundation of C++ and some physics and math for this class. Grades are graded based on coding assignments/projects. Professor is helpful with questions and accessible outside of class. Lecture introduces various game elements and HW implements those elements as practice. Class goes over 2D and 3D game development/modeling., I took CS116A,CS116B, and CS134 with Kevin. I can tell Kevin has a really good understanding about material that he is teaching. Your grade base on projects and exams, which are likely a take home Project. I definitely recommend people, who are interested in gaming and graphic filed, taking class with him. You will not regret!, An interesting CS course, dont think the skills will translate though if you arent planning to work on the graphic/gaming industry. Professor Smith is a nice guy and knows a lot. Responds to my email at a fast rate and with a professional manner. Grading is lenient. Take this course if you are looking to fill in a not-too-hard elective., I had Professor Smith for CS 134 and CS 116A/116B. You can tell he is very passionate about the topics he teaches. I had to take all of his classes online due to COVID, so unfortunately, I would zone out a lot during his lectures. I had to teach myself outside of class how to do the assignments because I got bored during the lectures., I took him for both CS 116A and CS 134. Professor Smiths approach is hands on, so there are a lot of programming projects. Both courses were a lot of work, but fun. Deadlines were generally reasonable, with only a few needing to be adjusted. Overall a very good professor. Most people struggle with the language (C++) so Id practice before taking., The class requires you to do a lot of self-learning and online research, and since this is a new topic I feel like this class is a little hard and can be confusing. This is just Intro to CG btw. I dont feel inspirational for graphics from this class. However, Kevin Smith is very caring and responsive thru email and office hours, so thats good., Kevins class is disorganized. He thinks up new homework on a random basis and changes plans for the class often. The rubric his grader grades with doesnt match the initial assignment. A lot of the information in his lecture is inaccurate. If you know C++ the class wont be difficult but the constant uncertainty will be stressful., Professor Smith is the best CS professor. He has a lot of experience in the game industry and he is supeeer helpful. If you dont understand something, you have to ask him to clarify that. Homework contains projects and in class assignments., Prof. Kevin Smith is really a go-to-professor and will put in hours to help you out. The assignments do require work but are really interesting. This course really helped me to gain confidence in UI/UX skills & I was able to target full-stack domain opportunities. Coursework is broad with areas from 2D to VR. Prof has a lot of experience in field., Course content is broad, you will get an overview of UI Design. Assignments are fun..."
Prateek Jain,/professor/2813873,2.0,25%,3.6,"he should be fired. unclear grading rubric, uses old semester dates. never responds to email, then dont become a professor, if you can not reply in a timely way. if you submit work late, his policy online says he has a grace period, makes up his own rules and decides no more grace policy. only 4 assignments in the grade book, worst professor ever, Expect to learn almost everything on your own. Video lessons only teach the basics of what is asked, if you want to finish the assignments, you need to learn outside from the course itself. Unfortunately contact is nearly nonexistent as well since he does not respond at a reasonable time. \n\nOnly take the course for the requirement, otherwise avoid., I took his 140 class and his 20B class, I dont agree with the rest of the posters here. However, I understand he changed his course structure for 140 recently, which worked great for me at least. He was straightforward and his classes and overall he was great- tho not too involved. His lectures provide enough info to work through the assignments., Dr. Jains lecture videos were informative., Lectures are extremely bare bones and have nothing to do with the homework. Had to spend most of the time learning it by myself on w3schools. Not sure if he knows that hes teaching a beginner class? Assignments kind of feel like asking an 8th grader to do 11th grade math., Professor fails to teach the necessary information that would help a student whos not experienced with Python in succeeding in his class., Not good. The professor doesnt teach the subject matter, then assigns nearly-impossible assignments. Seems to think students have much more background in the subject area than they do. Tons of students dropped out of this class, including myself. One of the most upsetting college experiences Ive had., Had a lot of hmwk and it was hard to keep up, especially cause most of the time he didnt explain in lecture. Had to search up the information online and he accused me of plagiarizing. Not sure how he expected us to know how to write code if he didnt explain it in his lectures. He stopped replying to emails so I had to drop and take coursera"
Joel Frank,/professor/1216631,3.4,100%,2.9,"Took him twice for AASB & AASA. Super funny guy, he is super passionate about Asian American Studies. He gives freebie assignments worth 1pt summarizing lectures he explained in class. Hes a lenient grader and hardly fails any students. His lectures are interesting since he summarizes them and makes them easier to understand. WOULD TAKE AGAIN!!!, Took him with Choi; definitely the easier grader. Bland lectures but he knows his stuff. Go into his office hours for help with the essay; hell show you which direction hell want you to head. Also, his exams are all short+long answers, so prepare to write., I found him hard at first, but now that Im in 46B I am so glad that I had him for a prof.  I am light years beyond the others in my class.  I would recommend this prof to anyone who really wants to learn how to code....not for the novice., He is not easy, and talks fast.  However, I am 46B right now, and half of what we are covering right now he covered last semester.  So last semester was rough, but now Im ahead of everyone else this semester., After the 1st test, the exams became all based on definitions, and no programming. He became aware that his teaching style was horrible from poor test performances of all students, and make them drastically easier. The final was a joke. It was pure definitions. Not one single program. Homework assignments did not correlate with lectures. After the, Fall 2008. I think he just got his MS before this semester. Didnt learn anything from him. New teacher, and young. Taking CS 46B right now, and feel so screwed because of him. I learned barely any Java. He talks extremely fast, and is hard to hear what he is saying. (PART 1/2), Professor Franks speaks very fast. He focuses a lot on core concepts and theory rather that the actual syntax. Has exams on paper, no laptops. Exams mostly on concepts, definitions, not syntax or how to code. A very fast paced course. You must also do the advanced windows tutorials. Take him if you are a self-motivated fast learner only."
Ken Tsang,/professor/2778566,5.0,100%,1.7,"Professor Ken is one of the professors that you will never regret taking. He is very nice, and EXTREMELY supportive when you need help. He responds quickly and explains everything just enough to unblockyou. Project is not easy, and you will need to learn new technologies that you have never used before, but he will point you in the right direction., Ken was an amazing professor! His lectures are concise and to the point and everything you need to know for the exams is on the slides. This class is project-based, so every week we have time to work on our projects with our groups in class. Overall, I learned a lot from the project and Ken was always there to help us if we ran into any problems!, Professor Ken is a fantastic person. He cares about each and every student. The class environment is so friendly. You can ask him questions anytime, and he will respond to you. I am happy that I took this class. I learned a lot from the group project. The midterm and final are so easy. For this class, you just need to focus on the project part., Absolutely amazing professor who is very friendly and chill to everybody, and gives students lots of helpful advice. Maintains a positive and lively atmosphere in the classroom, and makes very funny jokes while teaching to keep us engaged. Very supportive as well. I feel that there is no way anyone would be dissatisfied taking his class. Wonderful, Very chill. Grading was based on project, midterm, and final. Show up to class and ask for help, his advice is very helpful, Ken cares for his students and always offered help when students needed. He is also very proficient in web development and always helped students to answer related questions. I had no experience with web development before. Ken even taught me how to debug! Besides the school work, he also gave me career advice., Ken cares very much about his students and is very generous in grading."
Toshi Bhat,/professor/2961937,4.6,100%,3.4,"Had very open-ended homework and quizzes were very easy and usually reviewed in class so you could improve. Final group project was fun. He lectured with slides and it got boring at times, but everything on the quiz was on the lectures., Really nice and caring professor. As a new teacher, he made his midterm way too difficult but made up for it with super nice grading on the group projects, homework, and more fair final. Lectures a bit fast but concepts arent too hard to understand. Would recommend taking him., Pros: Extensive course knowledge, student feedback valued, respectful of time, enthusiastic about learning and participation. Balanced homework difficulty, quantifiable learning outcomes. Really cares about his students success\n\nCons: Lectures occasionally unfocused. Midterm tougher than quizzes. Inconsistent rubric knowledge with assignments., caring professor, always there to help. A lot of knowledge shared and does not mind explaining over and over again until you understand the topic. Hope Toshi continues to teach after his masters as I really admire his dedication to spreading knowledge to the class. Be aware exams are hard as he tests to see the knowledge you have attained., Mr. Bhat provided a lot of extra credit opportunities and was very caring towards all students. The exams were a little difficult, but they were fair. Thank you for the hard work."
Apoorva Mohite,/professor/2967991,3.3,50%,3.3,"Apoorva was ok at teaching. She would explain the concepts somewhat clearly but her content was very dry. Her grading criteria were also extremely vague and harsh, but she loosened up near the end of the semester. She gave a lot of freedom on the group project at the end of the semester and I feel like I learned a lot. Overall just average., Hard to work with: unresponsive to questions or answered with memes or counter-questions instead of helpful answers. Uses test questions like TrickyQuestion and MonsterQuestion designed to stump students. Assignments are vague and graded on a mystery rubric. Defensive when given any feedback. She\s smarter than you and wants you to know. Avoid., Shes a good professor and provides the slides afterwards for all her lectures. I would say the assignments are good practice for programming but her TA is not specific enough on what issues we had in our assignments and seems to be harsh with grading criteria. Nonetheless, she is great and actually wants you to succeed., First time teaching, yet the BEST professor I had last semester. Chill & understanding, open to feedback/suggestions. Responds fast on discord. Lectures: more on theory than application, but helpful for what to focus on for tests. Straightforward weekly quizzes based on slides/lecture. Strict programming assignments. High freedom in group project."
Natalie Linnell,/professor/1663697,4.5,N/A,3,"She is a good teacher. Unlike other teachers who teach that class, she is really helpful and her lectures are organized. Hw is hard, but it is not her fault as Horstmann take care of it. I would definitely recommend this class if you want a helpful teacher., I took User Interface Design-CS235 under Natalie Linnell.A really great professor. One of the few professors at SJSU who takes time to prepare for her class. She is very approachable and helpful. Gives a lot of work and also sufficient time to finish the work. Has organized lecture notes and slides, keeps every class interesting."
Margareta Ackerman,/professor/2207330,5.0,100%,2.5,"The best teacher I have had so far at SJSU. She makes sure that everyone understands the material. She gives reasonable amount of homework, and with more than enough time to complete them. Tests are pretty straight forward., Maya is really good at explaining complicated abstract concepts & gauging the level of her students. She doesnt go too fast or too slow. She makes sure that we understand before she proceeds  & uses different strategies to explain different things, which is very useful. She is very friendly, interactive with students, and passionate about teaching"
Thomas Hilderbrand,/professor/1645607,3.0,100%,4.5,"His assignment and project requirements are very clear. He is great at teaching virtualization technologies . a subject matter expert .., The prof does not have much experience in teaching at an university. Very hard to understand his expectations. If you miss specific keywords in answers, you would not get any credit. Project was for UI design but no emphasis was laid on checking core subject. Poor homework assignment, and grading rules. No one got an A in his class."
Maryam Hasan,/professor/2565932,3.0,0%,4,"Shes new to teaching and inexperienced. Accent hard to listen. Lecture boring and hard to follow. Isnt quite good at helping students questions. Her lecture slides are also tough to study by yourself. Tough grader for homeworks and midterm. Allows cheat sheet for midterm and final so its not hard doing those. No actual coding, just pseudocode."
Yonghwan Lim,/professor/2775841,5.0,100%,2,One of the best professors at SJSU! His CS155 classes were more like a leetcode/hackerrank problem. I thoroughly enjoyed his class and learn a TON of insight into solving data algorithm problems that many tech companies tend to ask in the interview. 11/10 would take again.
Reshaj Maskey,/professor/2820081,5.0,100%,2,"I had the privilege of being in Professor Maskeys class this semester, and it was an incredibly enriching experience.

Quizzes/exams have trick questions (unusual or not basic). Professor is helpful with QUICK grading, discord replies, adjusting deadlines., Expect weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final (all with lockdown browser). Everything you need to study is on the professors lecture slides. Study them well and you will secure an easy A. One term project throughout the semester with a submission of a new requirement each week. Rubrics are clear, follow directions and you will get full points., Class is pretty easy to keep up with, and his lectures are alright. Unfortunately, he has a negative attitude and is hostile toward students and I felt a bit awkward myself with how he talks to us sometimes., The professor is nice and you can tell he cares a lot about CS. 2 Midterms, 1 Final, weekly quizzes on lockdown browser, with all material being from the slides so attendence is optional. The final JavaFX group project was easy and rubric is always extremely clear. 0 homework. Great OOP lessons and slides., great lectures, responds to student questions quickly, passionate about teaching, cares about students. There are weekly quizzes which are pretty manageable, two midterms and a term project. He does a good job of summarizing all the points with examples, terrible professor, ineffective teaching skills, difficult and hard to deal with, I do not understand the negative reviews.Professor wants students to learn the concepts, not memorize them.If you watch his online lectures and practice, you should be good.Attending class is highly recommended because he sometimes goes over some example exercises not done in video lectures.Weekly quizzes,3 exams and a term project. Best professor., really sweet professor. lectures are straightforward + he has video versions so you dont HAVE to attend class, but i def suggest it to meet ppl since theres group coding assignments. weekly quizzes on lockdown browser with similar midterms. just study the slides well and follow his rubric for the coding projects., Although this professor claims he has no tricky questions in his exam,there were few in the recent mid-term. Many students share the same complaint. Tricky questions often lead to selecting both correct and incorrect answers in the multiple-choices part. And either students fail or get lower grades. I liked his lectures but not the quizzes/exams., Harsh grader, rude to students, tricky exams., One of the best professors Ive had. His lectures are clear and easy to understand. He has weekly quizzes. The midterms and finals are in a similar format. If you study the slides, theyll be a breeze. Follow his rubric for group assignments and you wont lose any points., Amazing professor, highly recommended., barley passed. so much weekly homework, teaching is straight forward. Very strict rules. Takes points off for simple things a lot. exam questions are tricky., Amazing instructor! Being taught by someone who is a current working professional in the field with decades of experience is a great opportunity. You will grow so much as a programmer in his class and feel better prepared for interviews. He posts slides and lectures which clear and helpful. Weekly quizzes prepare you for exams. Highly recommend., Definitely one of my favorite CS professors. He makes lectures so interesting and makes you want to learn more. He has weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. Make sure to review the lectures before taking the quizzes and watch his videos on youtube for review., Graded by weekly quizzes, midterms, final project, and final. Trick question everywhere. Lots of students complain about the trick questions but he refuses to acknowledge the complaints, and rather explain how students should know the difference., Teacher got bad compared to a couple of years ago. Trick questions are frequent, even though he prides himself on I don\t give out trick questions. Grade is made up of these weekly quizzes with trick questions which get harder as the semester goes on. Very unreasonable on grading and in Discord. Likes to take off points for small mistakes A LOT., Gets very defensive when students bring up complaints about his quiz questions. Likes to give a lot of trick questions where the intention is to deceive the student into losing a point. He claims he does not give trick questions, but if you ask most of the class they would say that there are many trick questions. I felt uncomfortable in his discord, I didnt put too much effort but the content he teaches is important. You will be fine if you watch lectures., Professor Yazdankhahs class is straightforward and his lectures are decent. However, I do wish he would have a more positive attitude toward his students and be more respectful generally. There have been a couple instances where my classmates have said they felt uncomfortable in his class, and I also do feel uncomfortable when he addresses us., The positive aspect of Professor Ahmads class is its simplicity. \nHowever, notable drawbacks include his reluctance to accept constructive criticism and strict. Another concern is his alleged targeting of students, with reports circulating about instances where he has disrespected and raised his voice at multiple individuals over trivial matters., My experience with this guy was overshadowed by their reluctance to provide constructive feedback on assignments. Despite my efforts to improve, the minimal guidance offered left me feeling uncertain about my academic progress and undermined my motivation to excel in the course., Professor Yazdankhah exhibited a lack of responsiveness to emails and inquiries, making it challenging to get timely answers to important questions. This lack of communication hindered my ability to grasp certain concepts, and it was frustrating to feel overlooked as a student seeking guidance., I recently had a disappointing experience with Professor Ahmad. Despite my attempts to seek help and clarification, they consistently showed a lack of willingness to assist students. This created a challenging learning environment, and I felt unsupported throughout the course., Ahmad was a great professor, but due to certain things happening in Spring 2023, he has adjusted his policies and now every week there is a lockdown quiz. In which you will competing against people who most likely find a way to cheat, so bear that in mind. Also every week there is a quiz and term project assignment, no time to study or relax., In this class, you will probably end up having fun with your new friends after you choose to become part of a project team together and build an interesting project using JavaFX. I use the skills I learned here daily as part of my SWE internship, and I can say I learned a lot of useful things in this class., In Prof. Ahmads class, theres a manageable workload and straightforward teaching. The pros include the ease of the course. Prof also struggles with feedback, maintains strict rules, and students feel disrespected or overly criticized in minor situations with his passive aggressive tone on his class discord., This better not get deleted since Im following the guidelines. Pros of Prof. Ahmad is easy class. Cons is he doesnt take constructive criticism and is overly strict. Another issue is him targeting students, you can ask around and people will tell you that he has disrespected and yelled at multiples students for simple reasons., Watch the lectures(prerecorded) & youll pass easily bc they contain the answer to all questions on his exams. He highlights points that will be tested on and even sometimes straight up tell you a likely question on the next exam. Only issue may be his exams are all cumulative with his midterm/final low on time. Also, get a good team for term proj., Very chill and understanding professor.  Very funny and has good lectures with examples that really help understand stuff.  The term project is a lot of work so a bad team can really hurt you in this class., You will never finish the quizzes and exams within the given time limit. I dont have enough time to finish. The questions were never straightforward. MCQ is tricky sometimes, and the free responses questions is kinda iffy. Also, he never ever turns on his camera but we are forced to turn it on during exam time when already have a lockdown browser., Having taken Professor Yazdankhah for CS 151, 154, and 166, hes an amazing professor. His lectures are well-structured and clear. He provides you with everything you need to know to succeed. The only reason you would struggle is a lack of effort on your part. If you review and understand all of the content hes taught in class, you will do well., Took CS151,152 & 166 with prof Y. Can you tell I love this guy?! Not only an EXCELLENT prof, but also cares about his studs. Puts great effort on his lectures and even tho the courses are challenging by nature, he finds a way to make each topic super clear. I am graduating this sem and  prof Y has been my fave by far and the only prof I will miss., Ahmad is the GOAT, hes my absolute favorite CS professor because he teaches 151 (object oriented programming) so well yet is so caring about his students. His lectures are slow yet fast paced and easy to understand. His term project is highly engaging, challenging in a good way, and a good resume enhancer. I would take him again for another class., The GOAT. Weekly quizzes, really in-depth lectures, no textbook (have to watch video before class, discuss in class), midterm and final were not bad, 1 group project at end. Funny moments in class, can tell he loves to teach and cares for his students, would 100% recommend. Content can be difficult for some but I really enjoyed learning the theory., Ahmad is a gem! Please take him if you can. He makes difficult concepts extremely easy to understand and is a really fast grader as well. Weekly quizzes, just make sure you watch the lecture video. Extremely accommodating Professor as well. A Professor with the biggest heart Ive ever met., The jewel of SJSUs CS department, genuinely has passion for what he teaches. Extremely organized class, as you know how all quizzes, assignments, and exams are graded (he grades very quickly too, as assignment grades come out a few hours after theyre due). He has many interesting anecdotes and is always open to questions. Thank you professor!, One of the kindest and most understanding professors Ive ever had. Posts all of his lectures on Youtube so students can watch whenever we want. Takes time to go through every quiz and answer every question, and put the questions that students made mistake on in the next quiz. I also like his little jokes here and there, quite funny man., One of the best professors in the entire CS Dept. Very caring, very flexible. He was flexible on the dates for the exams, assignments were straight-forward, lectures were funny and informative. Loved it., This was my only class with this professor but I learned a lot and nothing in the class felt like a waste of time. There is a decent bit of homework with a program each week for every cipher system but tools are provided to make it as streamlined as possible. I very much enjoyed the course and would gladly take it again., Honestly one of the best CS classes Ive taken here. Posts videos before class and reviews them during in-person lecture. Super kind and always willing to spend extra time to help you if youre stuck. Towards the end of the semester, he spent hours after lecture helping people debug their final projects. Take him if you can., Good choice! Posts lecture videos beforehand (1 hr long), so you dont need to go to class. Really wants us to ask him questions if were confused. Exams & quizzes are closed-notes and time-crunched (1 min per question). Group project isnt too bad. Never turns his camera on so it was weird when he made us turn them on for exams but he didnt., The guy is funny and nice, but cant teach. Avoid., Professor Yazdankhah is a great professor! Absolutely recommend CS151 with him. His lectures are clear, and the material is engaging. The group project is also interesting (granted you get a good group), and you get to learn a lot., Hes a great professor! Lectures are very straightforward and easy to understand. He also provides videos that are helpful to reference. Quizzes and exams are also straightforward from the lectures. Hes also very open to answering questions students have for him., Quizzes and exams are completely based on the slides. In his lecture videos, he makes everything crystal clear. In class, he goes over any questions students may have (students rarely has questions because videos are super clear so we usually dismiss class early). Highly recommend!, Kind of a strange teacher, but his lectures are amazing! No textbook- the class is based off his slides (which are great). Quizzes and tests are based off slides and lecture. There is 1 semester-long group project. He expects you to show up to every class, and will end class early if he finishes early. Would definitely recommend this Prof.!, Professor Yazdankhah is absolutely hilarious. I wish the quizzes were at least slightly more difficult because they only really tested basic knowledge youd get from skimming slides so it made me a bit lazy when studying, but to each their own. The class is not difficult and Professor Yazdankhah teaches clearly and succinctly., Just take him period, absolutely A M A Z I N G! His class is so enjoyable, his lectures are easy to understand, and you learn a whole lot of concepts that was actually asked in interviews. Youre missing out if you dont get to take his class!!!, Please take his 151 section if its available! Trust me this professor will not disappoint. His quizzes and midterms are based from his lectures., SUCH SUCH SUCH a great professor. Lectures are so good that time actually flies by. Theyre so easy to understand you forget this is an upper div class. Hes always laughing and happy. TAKE HIM!!!, Hes an awesome professor! His quizzes and midterms are heavily based on his lectures so make sure to pay attention. His lectures arent too bad and he explains well. I also heard hes one of the easiest 151 professors compared to others., Group project, guides you through each phase. Quizzes and exams are all in lecture slides (which btw is amazing and concise). I cant ask for a better professor. His lectures are the ones that dont give you stress bc theyre so smooth and well-explained! Take him!, Best CS professor at SJSU hands down! Lectures are CRYSTAL CLEAR bc he spends hours editing them. Work load is very reasonable and reflects lecture. All quiz and exams are pulled directly from lecture. WHAT AN AMAZING PROF!!!!, The class is easy to follow if we pay attention at classes. HWs are related to lecture., Very good teacher who makes you understand the topic in detail with ease., Weekly HWs, a midterm, a term project, and a final are almost all programming assignment in Java using cryptography related utility library. Lectures posted on YouTube are enough to finish programming assignments. Professor is willing to help for HWs and exams. Perfect class for COVID-19 situation - programming focused and clear lectures., Professor Ahmad was one of the best professors I had at SJSU. He really cares about his students. Make sure to really pay attention to the lectures and do the problems he tells you to do at home. There is a quiz every week, but if you understand the lectures, you will do well. Overall, this class wasnt easy, but Professor Ahmad is great!, He has a good personality and he is high in IQ and EQ. He is easy to talk with and his lectures are great. Maybe I felt this class was too easy to study so I did not spend much time on it. As a result, I did badly on the tests. His tests are crazy. The time is not enough to finish all the questions unless you are really familiar I guess., My view of this class may be different from urs bcuz it went online due to Covid 19 (had access to class recordings). Hes good at teaching. But boy, the exams have so many questions for the time given. Making a diagram takes longer online. U use JFLAP, take a screenie, upload to canvas files, embed it. Noticed a mistake on the pic? Repeat that. Ugh, Didnt give a crap about anyones issues transitioning to online during this covid situation. 15% of class wasnt able to finish 2nd midterm and final because of new requirements but still giving the same amount of time as in person exam. Doesnt hold office hours or answer questions. Says post discussion. Overall smartass., This course (formal languages) was surprisingly fun given the subject material. Prof. Yazdankhah is an excellent lecturer, and enjoys engaging with students in the class room. You will need to be on your toes in this course, as he tends to add trick questions on the weekly quizes, but as long as you pay attention youll get an A. Good Professor., Im not gonna lie the class is not easy. No coding in this class, basically we learn about computer machines early in CS history. The material can be hard sometimes, and the class needs stable studying time to follow up every week. The term project is extremely time-consuming and hard. The teachers funny and friendly. Reachable and helpful., 1 Quiz every Thursday, lecture gets boring and easy to be sidetracked, but without attending it can get confusing near the end of the course. Attendance not graded. Ahmad, however, is a super chill and is a funny dude. Dont bother arguing with him however; I promise you will NOT win. Hes a very straightforward guy and VERY clear on instructions, Need at least 13 scantrons throughout the semester for weekly Thursday quizzes. He treats students like dogs and throws candy to students for answering questions or asking decent questions., This is the first ever rating ive ever made and probably my last. But seriously this is the best lecturer on campus - he keeps a pretty mundane subject very interesting and is super interactive with students. One of the best courses ive taken and its because of him. You will not regret taking this class. Make sure to go to every class., He is a really great guy. Absolutely understanding and does his best to make the dry subject engaging. Really wants students to succeed. He brings chocolate and Madeline cookies so thats a bonus. Focus on the slides and take good notes of what he says in class. He gives a decent amount of hints on what will be on the quizzes so dont skip class., Professor Yazdankhah is really the best lecturer to be honest in the CS Department. He explains every concept crystal clearly and his slides are self explanatory. You will find his lectures never boring because he has such a strong sense of humor that he could turn everything mundane into jokes that I would want to laugh about!, So easy, great professor, very friendly and very funny. Take him for 154, I cant imagine him teaching another class., Ahmad is the best professor I have ever had. He makes a great amount of preparation before lecture and thus his lectures are very clear and easy to follow. He is sometimes very funny and frequently gives out chocolate/madeleine for correctly answering/asking questions in his class! I have really learned a lot with him! Taking his class was the best, Best Professor ever!! He loves teaching and helping students. I wish all teachers were like him. This is the only class I feel like going in because professor is so caring and enthusiastic for teaching. Highly recommended. I wish he teaches more classes so I can actually learn something., He LOVES THIS CLASS and you will too if you pay attention. Quiz questions are tricky at first but are weekly and cumulative with repeated questions so you get the hang of it quickly, and you will learn the material thoroughly. His slides make it very clear what you need to know, and his lecturing is entertaining and informative. A+ teacher, I liked his class. Would take him again., He definitely the best teacher I have had so far at this University. He cares more about you growing as a Computer Scientist than you passing the class. Now dont get me wrong he wants you to pass. Going to class is recommended. His lectures are very clear. Quizzes every week. I love this guy., This teacher has weekly quizzes. Most of them are repeats from previous quizzes, with a couple of new from the new material. His classes are interactive and he makes even the most abstract class into a practical class with tangible examples. If youre participating and show him youre using youre head during class you might even get a chocolate ;), Ahmad is a great professor. Ive taken him for both CS 151 and CS 154, and Ive loved his class both times. He gives minimal homework, but gives a fairly easy quiz each week for easy points and memorization, which helps a lot on his tests.   Ahmad is generally just a fun guy, and hes probably my favorite professor at SJSU. Would take again., Lectures slides are easy to understand. He is a fun teacher who rewards student participation in class with chocolate! Weekly quizzes are easy because they are based on his slides and mostly multiple choice. Overall, easy grader, intuitive slides, and easy to get an A while learning key points b/c he repeats quiz questions so it sticks in your head, A pretty easy class. Weekly quizzes, where you memorize some stuff off of lecture powerpoints that he posts up online. Its all conceptual stuff. He can be somewhat disorganized and his test questions/instructions are ambiguous at times . His lectures are interesting enough to keep me awake. Group project is worth a pretty big chunk of grade., This class is a very easy going and clear class. He gives weekly quizzes and honestly even though it sounds brutal, it is very beneficial in the long run. I didnt have to study longer than 30 minutes for the final exams and midterms. Homework was straightforward. Group project wasnt bad either. Lecture slides are straightforward & no book require, The thing that requires the most work for his class is the group project. He may be unorganized at times but I would take him again. I honestly thought I was gonna get a lower grade than what I actually got. He curves fairly. He was a pretty funny guy, get on his good side. Oh yeah and he gives out chocolate sometimes :D, Professor Yazdankhah was a good professor, and Im glad I took CS146 with him. Lectures were very clear. Assignments were challenging, and sometimes vague, but far from impossible. Most of the time the pseudocode was right in the textbook! His on-paper assignments were easy. The final wasnt bad - half of it was open-book! 1010 would take again., Tests are tough. Group projects make up a lot of your grade. Grading criteria isn\t very clear. Won\t assign a grade to your project until you resubmit, but will take off points for resubmission. To tell you the truth, just stay away from this teacher., Fairly easy grader, if you have a good group who understands whats going on because theres only two projects done which is a majority of your grade. Lots of quizzes in the first two months of the semester and it starts dwindling down. Take him if you dont like a lot of work. Hard to understand his lectures., Hes unprepared and grades really toughly. The projects are 60%+ of your grade and he only gives 2 of them. If they dont work EXACTLY as he feels they should work including things that werent in the description of the assignment, then he will mark you down or wont grade your project. Simply put, dont take it with him., terrible professor, he always assume you know everything from the beginning to the end of the chapters without discussing or talking about it in the class, and once he puts a random assignment out of no where on canvas , you would have no idea how to approach it :(, He is not really well-prepared for the class. No homework or assignments whatsoever. When he gave out one, its extremely complicated.   Always assume that students knew what hes talking about already. So whats the point of going to class then?  Occasional grammar mistakes in lecture slides.  I would recommend NOT taking him., Nice guy. Decent teacher. Communication skills could use some work when it comes to assignments. Multiple times he would post an assignment online without mentioning it in class. Maybe I should be better at checking online, but a quick word in class would be appreciated., He expects you to know everything already, thus the extremely difficult assignments, which is worth 100 points :( Skip several parts of lecture. I know some of it is on my, but if I have the chance to go back, Id take it with another professor., Horrible teacher, dont take any computer science class with him. He doesnt give practice problems at all. He expects you to know all the material that is in the book and he has either a quiz or a test every week without giving us any practice problems to study., Awesome Teacher!!!"

The teacher was available to answer questions. He was extremely responsive to email questions, which I greatly appreciated., Excellent professor who can clearly explain subjects. Useful assignments and project. If you approach him with questions, he is extremely helpful., Topics he teach are a bit low level in depth, but you can easily learn things. His experience makes the class more interesting. I would recommend you guys to take the class., The lectures he gives and the slides he provides are extremely useful. He records his lectures and uploads them to Canvas. Fantastic professor with great understanding in Databases., Excellent class. I strongly recommend it. Dont miss his lecture. If you have the opportunity to study databases under him, take advantage of it. He has worked for Oracle, and his industry experience is evident in his lectures., I would highly recommend Professor Ezzat. he is highly knowledgeable and strives to give back to the community by teaching. Dont miss an opportunity to take his class., The exams and projects are reasonably challenging and reinforce the concept well. Sufficient time is given to prepare. Professor is always available for any queries we may have., The lectures presented and the slides that he provides are very helpful. Although the lectures are in-person, he records them and uploads to canvas. Amazing professor with good sense of humor., Contrary to popular belief, professor actually encourages asking doubts and clarifies even the smallest ones. Always asks is that clear now and will explain again of not clear. Also says thanks for asking when you ask doubts., Great class. Would highly recommend. Dont miss his class. If you have an opportunity to study databases under him, go for it. He has worked in Oracle and that industry experience shows in his lectures as they are practically tailored to meet the industrial requirements. He also encourages research. AMAZING professor!, one of the few classes in which i actually understood the material. very systematic and helpful professor., Prof. Ezzats class is the one I enjoy most this semester. There is never a dull moment and he connects with all of us so well. It is always a class where learning meets fun. It is the best possible way to learn. \n\nHe encouraged us to ask questions in the very first class and even appreciated me for asking a good question., Disappointing course, Easy pass, go to class. If you skip a quiz, then your grade will be a miss., one of the worst professors I had till date. No clear guidance on the course and no clear teaching of concepts. If students ask questions for clarity, they get yelled at. Overall, not a good experience and best to avoid him if there are other options., Not an easy A, Even though he is experienced, his knowledge of content is nix. Boasts about himself. Making mistakes as a professor isnt wrong, but when students point it out, instead of accepting it, he yells at them. Because of this even the most interested students get demotivated. Overall I will not recommend his class even just for credits, He is not clear explaining material and when you ask questions, he yells at you. Not recommended, Worst professor ever!Avoid if you can! He was very mean and rude to student and screams at us when we ask questions.I was like,Is he really a teacher? Feels like he hate his students so much and I dont think that he should be in a school and try to give students hard time. please, avoid him or your life will be ruin!, Very mean and often talks down to students. His lectures are all over the place. You wont learn anything from him. He doesnt care at all about students. A real disgrace to SJSU., He mumbles without any clarity in his lecture. Very rude and arrogant. Dont expect help. Screams at students if simple questions asked. Please avoid., He has a bad temper and is really annoying. Lectures not clear and confusing. You should ask question but he is sometimes not polite and rude. He does not teach anything in class, so you are on your own with the textbook. Avoid if you can., Ahmed has become a endearing friend to me. I agree with the comments that his lectures can be boring but he makes up for it in his genuine interest for students to learn and pass his course. Not only does he curve he gives exam previews that the questions can be found straight out of the textbook. It is easy to get a good grade in his class., Worst professor ever... Did not learn anything from his class. His lecture is just keeping talking, nothing but windbaggery, and you will never find any relation to the exam. The exam is totally unexpected, even you read the book carefully, reviewed the ppt, but still dont know what is testing and how to answer. Arrogant prof, not care about student, Horrible professor.  He will talk about his past experience at least 3 times per day.  Not great at teaching.  Reads boarding slides every lecture.  Very arrogant.  Not recommended., Ezzat lectures straight out of the book and is very hard to understand. He is quite intimidating and acts arrogant in a way that makes him scary to approach. In addition, he uses a relative grading system and denies people the grades that they have truly earned. Even if he has industry experience, this man is stuck in the past and cant teach well., Prof wont teach anything useful, just  mumbles  without any clarity in his speech. Very rude and arrogant. Yells at students if question asked. No clear grading criteria. Avoid., Dr. Ezzat is extremely knowledgable and genuinely cares about seeing his students succeed. He has a ton of industry experience and so he tries his best to teach content that will be relevant in the real world. He is always approachable, fair with homework load and also fair in grading methods., This guy loves Oracle a lot. His lectures are not interesting. Test questions are very different from the lectures. Be careful. He will talk on and on about things that do not matter and will not show up on the test. He is a sweet guy and he is actually an amazing person. Possibly an amazing boss. But.. not a good professor., Professor is really caring and will go out of his way to help you out! Be ready to study from the study guide and exams are straightforward! He can some times lose patience but he never holds a grudge in any way!, Professor Ezzat is a really good professor! He cares more about students understanding the course material and how to implement what they learned rather than trying to test or pile homework. Exams are fairly easy along with his grading. Homework can be a bit tougher but hes always open to help! Id recommend him!, He may come off as being rude at first but hes a sweet person from the inside, where it counts. If you talk to him individually, he is often very understanding. Lectures have real world examples and exams are not too difficult -- he gives a review sheet which relates closely to the actual exam. Homework can be tough so start early! Good Luck!, Okay, honestly, he does not explain anything properly and then gets mad at students for asking questions, even after he tells us to ask him questions. He yells at students. He gets all his assignments off of professor Mak. I would not recommend him, at all., Horrible professor. Does not teach you anything. He goes over slides taken from random places on the internet. Questions are brushed off. Avoid if you can., Very unhelpful and easily irritated. Lecture notes are blatantly ripped from the book, assignment notes will sometimes not match what he wants us to do or be outdated. While its nice that he has industry experience, he seems a bit stuck in the past, praising himself a lot. Lots of theory, but youll do very little actual coding. Avoid if possible., Awesome Teacher!!!, My first class with this professor and he is very hard to hear to understand through his thick accent. Prof is a bit annoying as he name drops a lot. Not a very good presenter at all, not easily approachable and does not engage the students well. Class materials are taken off randomly from the internet. Avoid if you can if there are better choices, Professor Ezzat is a awesome teacher. He has many years of experience in the job industry. I really recommend him. The best professor in the computer science department., Good teacher, reasonable slides and good explanations. Makes the subject very easy to understand and enjoyed taking the class with Professor Ezzat, Has credible industry experience which you should take advantage of, always answers questions. I see a lot of people complaining about his style, but Im thankful I took this class with him., No real coding, some pseudo-code and a lot of theory. If you want to learn more and do hands-on coding, dont take him.  If you want to make sure you pass this class and dont care about learning hands-on, take him. Also, he often answers more questions during tests than he should., This prof is really bad. Once he shouted at a student in our class. He is the most arrogant man I have ever seen. He goes over slides quickly, does not answer questions by just brushing them off. No programming assignments. Wont explain the concepts well. Not recommended., Its Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms. The entire concept is going to be difficult no matter what. Professor isnt of much help with homework, but in lectures he does his best to help with any and all questions. Take advantage of his industry experience and ask questions that try to relate class concepts with the real world., From what I heard, Ezzat was brought to fill in classes that didnt have enough sections, which is shown in his effort. All lectures are run off of pre-made slides and sometimes doesnt know whats on them. No coding assignments, all theory Qs from the book. However, hes inspiring and shows experience in the industry. Great person, bad professor., I dont really write rating, but this guy is exceptionally bad. Bad habit:He is always right, name drop, go over slide in 10 mins, does not know his stuff. If you dont have any choice, then take him. Good luck! Btw, He is the same professor from Santa Clara University. You can see his rating over there for more detail."
Faramarz Mortezaie,/professor/2148983,3.5,68%,3,"Easy professor. He is lazy, so you can turn whatever you want in, and you will always get a full grade. He teaches at four community colleges and universities at the same time, so his quality of teaching is not really high., Prof Mortezai is one the best cs teacher ive had at SJSU. Take him, he is sarcastic and give good examples to learn OS. He is really good grader and wants you to pass., Exams were copy and paste of the practice exams and the online HW questions. If you are willing to cram and memorize them, you should easily get Bs on the midterms. The final is much harder and requires hand writing code. If you do good on the 1st two exams, project, and all the HW, you should be able to bomb the final and pass with a B., Honestly, I think Prof. Mortezaie is very chilled and lazy lol. But his lecture isnt too difficult. Also he provided a practice exam before the real exam, the real exam contents basically are the same as the practice exam. So I think getting an A is very easy in this class., I dont know why Prof Mortezaie doesnt have a higher score, he is funny and great at teaching. I took Prof Andreopouloss class, but it was too much homework so I dropped it. Prof Mortezaies class is rather exam-based (medium-level difficulty) with fewer assignments (easy-med level). He records all lectures so I only attended exam days, TAKE HIM, One of the Best Professors so Far No Mandatory Attendance. Exams are also based on exam reviews provided by him., Had prof for cmpe30 and is just as good for 126. Lectures are a bit slow but he breaks them down in a way that are easily understandable. Posts review questions/topics for exactly what will be on the exam and is a pretty lenient grader. Records all lectures and uploads onto canvas., He did a great job when explaining the abstract concepts of OS by using normal-life analogy to make sure everyone could understand. No cheatsheet in the exams, so it kinda makes the exams be harder than usual. Take this professor, study all the materials and complete all the homework, then you should be fine., Lectures are boring but decently informative with visuals & analogies to ease the learning curve. Exams have coding in C on paper & lean closer to difficult than medium. His study guides are quite vague. Group project was long & difficult. Grading strictness on HW and discussions depends on his TA. Hes caring & does give extensions when necessary., Chill class, he records lectures so you dont even have to go to class. But honestly, lots of topics can be found on YouTube, though youll still want to skim through the lectures. Light weekly HW, doable in 1 day. Although tests are medium-hard difficulty so youll want to study for that. He gives a study guide for those but theyre 100% accurate., Learning C, not too bad, lots of outside resources. Grading criteria for the homework was kinda confusing, taking off points for what feels like no reason. Class is pretty straight forward since its just coding. Reviewing old tests for the final is helpful., Nice prof just kinda low energy. He often just posts the answers to the current hw for some reason. I found reading the textbook to be easier than paying attention to his lectures. Didnt feel like I learned that much. Exams are medium-hard difficulty IMO, you will want to study for them., Prof Mortezie is great. His lectures may seem low energy at times but he does care about his students learning the material. For CMPE30, his class is pretty easy and beginner friendly. Make sure you read your book and stay on top of your homework/labs. Midterms and final are straightforward., Lectures in circles. Understanding/nice if you talk to him in class.\nDiscussion+hw almost every week, but falls behind schedule. Takes forever to grade assignments (other than midterms/final). Really bamboozled us with the final (misleading final review). \nUnderstand/self study the hw to do well, keep an updated cheat sheet for tests, 3.5 is way too low of a rating for Professor Mortezaie. This guy is probably among the nicest professors I have met at SJSU. As the other reviews say, sometimes it can seem like low energy, but he genuinely cares about his students. Hes also a really funny dude so that helps when he explains concepts, he mixes a bit of humor. Take him! Hes great., Professor Mortezaie is so supportive of all his students! He definitely appreciates class participation and is always willing to go line by line in his code explanations. I for sure recommend him to anyone who struggled with CS in the past. Took class for grade forgiveness AND omg did I understand Operating Systems and C soooo much better with him., Lectures the entire 50 minutes but his examples are helpful. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework, the midterms and final are easy. Also very flexible if you need to reschedule an exam or homework date., Regarding CMPE 30 specifically, most of the learning was done during the lab. Attendance wasnt required but still helpful for learning the concepts. Would definitely recommend attending the last few lectures though as some topics were covered there which werent taught in lab. Overall he was a good professor., Great lecturer, goes over content really well and uses analogies to make content digestible. The book is great too, use it to understand things better. Lectures were recorded. Be sure to actually do the homework to prep for the tests. You get a cheatsheet. My only gripe is I felt there was too many trick problems on the tests, so read carefully., I took Mortezaie for CMPE 102 and CMPE 126. Amazing professor, as long as you attend class and pay attention you can pass the class easily. His lectures can be all over the place (and can get a bit monotone) but he always ties it to the exams so listen up when he says something like it will be in our exam or something like that. cheers!, Lectures are rather confusing, and if you have him in the morning you might fall asleep. Grades veeeery slowly, and grading criteria isnt really clear. Also is unresponsive to emails. However, in class he does his best to answer students questions thoroughly and provide explanations. Overall a good guy, just needs improvement as a professor., Professor is one of the kindest teachers I have ever had. He cares about the students learning and grades. You simply have to do what he assigns and the class designed for you to Atleast pass. He is also available outside of class and very skilled in explaining concepts in a way that makes sense., Im taking CMPE102 of this professor. Everything is great until now. Just always come to the class, stay focused on his lecture, and prepare to do the assignments some days before due dates. If youre stuck on some parts of his lecture, feel free to write email or come ask him, he will reply to you very fast!, Dont take this guy. His lecture is one of the most boring pieces of garbage Ive ever had the displeasure of finding myself attending, and his tests dont coorelate in any respect with his lecture or his homework. Honestly, youre better off postponing taking this class if hes your only option. DONT TAKE THIS GUY!, Took him during the summer, Good professor, answers questions clearly with good examples like when he explains deadlocks and hes not rude about it like profs can be sometimes. Two exams where each are 30 percent of your grade so not a fan of that. Doesnt grade with participation but keeps it in mind when students are near the grade threshold., He is one of the best professors Ive had in the department. He knows how to explain topics and is open to questions. He curves exams if necessary. HW is reasonable and doable. He goes over exams and HW. He can be lazy at times and may not seem ready to teach, however, mostly he is a decent professor., Doesnt show up prepared for lectures and spends time looking for code to use as examples instead of explaining the concepts to us. Did not post the final on the scheduled date; an exam that was meant to be proctored via lockdown browser and video monitoring. Lectures are unorganized and boring -- take this professor only if you must., He is one of the best professors in the department. He lectures pretty well and posts extra videos/notes to help students learn. He is flexible with due dates if you ask him. Overall, fairly chill professor., Most of the learning is done in labs. There are a lot of HW assignments, 2 exams which were decent, and the final was a bit hard. But, Prof. Mortezaie is a good professor and his lectures help. He is very flexible with his students, he gave us either in person or online class attendance option which made it very convenient., stay away. i have almost a perfect gpa, studied hours especially during the weekends of exams, and went to every lecture. i still got a B, not even a B+. he doesnt respond to emails either :), Weekly homework and short quizzes on canvas. For the HW, some are easy, some take a bit more time, but nothing crazy difficult. Try to pay attention to lectures and refer to the textbook for the HWs and you should be able to get an A or B easily. Grading was a little slow. There was supposed to be a project but it didnt happen for us., He cured my sleeping disorder. His lecture is the worlds best lullaby. I open his lecture recordings at night to sleep. Take him if you have a sleeping problem! Best therapy ever!, Discussion every week, pop quiz which is freakin proctored (who does that?!) 2 Midterms, Final. Its impossible to cheat in his class because no one knows the answers. Bring a pillow to class so that your head dont crash on the desk when you pass out. And bring a pillow for your pillow coz your pillow will fall asleep too. Finalword DONT TAKE HIM, DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR, I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. His lecture is so boring that you wont even care to attend class. He doesnt care to explain anything when you ask him. His tests are super heavy and hard and it doesnt relate to the lecture at all. He wont give any curve or extra credit. MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE COVID-19 VIRUS, This class is way too hard. He doesnt give any further explanations when you ask questions., Solid teacher. Not amazing, not bad. Will teach you things and it will make sense. Homework is not easy but not hard as long as youre following the class. Cares about students and is lenient. Would recommend him if none of the other teachers are amazing., He explains really well and doesnt grade very harshly, take him!, Ive had professor Mortezaie for both cmpe30 and cmpe102. He is considerate and caring towards the students. Learning from cmpe30 is mostly done in labs, but the lectures do really help. In cmpe102 there are weekly quizzes which he pretty much goes over before you take. Homework is really not that heavy and they help you learn material., His lectures and quizes to not match. His lectures consist of him writing code and occasionally showing your his hand written notes that only make sense for him. You must go out of your way and review quizlets from other students and a few things that the professor highlights. Quizes and exams really effect your grade., Certainly the worst class Ive ever taken in my college career. 3 exams 75% and 25% for quiz and. He is really disorganized, not ready to teach all the time and test are really challenging. No extra credit, no curves, no office hours, nothing. Doesnt respond to emails either. Self study class with someone who doesnt care at all. God bless you., Really doesnt care about his students. Hw and exams had no relation to each other whatsoever. Learned nothing at all. Most of what we did was never explained how we would use it in real life. Self-learned absolutely everything. Never responded to emails. Didnt have office hours either. Exams were impossible., Honestly, I had to self-learn everything in this class. The only material he provided that I learned through was the homework. The midterms and final are a big % too. 1 project at the end of the semester that he did not even prepare us for. I felt like I learned nothing from him. The lectures are too lecture heavy and his notes are a total mess., Really learn the material while he is lecturing it. Make sure to understand and visualize each concept given on each data structure or algorithm. Take notes on laptop and make visualizations on what he is lecturing and make a study guide of each concept. Be prepared for coding questions on the test that can be related to any concept you learned., Took him in summer. Always answers your questions. There were about 4 homework and about 10 labs. They were easy if you put some effort. There was a final group project with the SJOne board. He values your effort and gives grade according to that. Would take him again for CmpE 102., The professor has no desire to teach. Goes over little things in whats supposed to be a huge lesson in a matter of 15 minutes. Awkward silences for 10. Then tells us to write a program he makes up on the spot. Doesnt give us guidelines on how to tackle it, no feedback on hw or tests. No enthusiasm. Im surviving but, I hate this class. Dont take., His 8AM CMPE30 class is alright. He knows his material but has a hard time getting it across to his students. Mainly learned everything from working on projects in the lab and self-learning. Hes a good teacher but his lectures could be better., Based on personal experience with his 8 AM CMPE 30 class, Id say attendance isnt important until near the end of the semester, majority of learning came from labs. Posts study guides online although they are a bit messy, they are pretty accurate to the midterms. Seldom gives homework, they can be a bit challenging but are graded leniently., This is one of those classes were almost all of the learning is from the lab. As long as if you do all the lab work and make sure you understand it, you should pass this class. There are some things on the final that isnt taught in the lab, so you should show up to the last few lectures at the end of the semester. Online notes are really bad., boring professor and unprepared for Lectures. Had him in the AM, he would write down what he is saying during the lecture on an IPad and would frequently read off his own notes or the book. Takes pictures of the book during the lecture for his slides. Needs prepared slides/info and didnt cover everything needed in class, now unprepared for CS158B, Professor Mortezaie is a great professor. His homework was moderately difficult but definitely manageable. Hes a professor that really cares about his student passing his class.  He made Data Structure pretty easy to comprehend. Also the group projects were fun to do. But I suggest you start on those early! Highly recommended."
Johnny Martin,/professor/886674,2.1,N/A,3.7,"I am glad he is not teaching anymore, what a horrible teacher. He was all over the place and at the end of the class he would scribble on the board and that was his lecture. He would spend most of the class hour talking about his personal issues, and things he did not like about the department., RIP Johnny Martin, The class has no text book.  The only guidance you get for preparing for a test is do the home work.  Which actually only helps a little.  Homework is only worth 4% of your grade yet it is a lot of work.  If you take this get ready for chaos., AVOID! He misgrades most of the midterms. If youre forced to take him, make sure you check his answer keys he posts online. But good luck getting pts back because he never responds to email., He says will test you on your knowledge of a given programming language but rather he will test you on tricks.  Impossible to study for tests as there is no real course material to study from.  Half of the lecture is personal stories, as interesting as they are, they are totally useless in retrospect to how the class is doing., He doesnt teach, talks poorly about his colleagues during lectures, never goes to office hrs, never answers emails, forgets to upload HW, errors in quiz questions, quizzes dont test knowledge but useless details about subject material. DO NOT TAKE., Expects you to know subtle differences on the exams (tricky questions), but doesnt even lecture about it. Instead, he expects you to program on your free time to find subtle differences., Nice guy, but not a good teacher.  Ask only trick question on the tests.  Which are multiple choice.  Makes three of the four possible answer very close to right to trick you into picking them.  Insane homeworks that are only worth 4% of your total grade., Bad professor in SJSU I wish he would retire soon., Avoid taking a class with this professor at all costs (if possible). For my major he was the only choice for three classes that I could take and I must say by far this is the worst professor Ive ever taken. His code is all buggy (including in his notes) and he debugs in class time more than lectures. Very slow on just about everything. Irrational., pros: he appears passionate, funny, tells you nice stories, class atmosphere is nice, homeworks are challenging in a good way, only way to learn in  his class cons: unorganized, only teaches average 20 minutes out of 1:15 minutes class, the other section with another teacher covered so many topics, we only covered a fraction of what they covered, He is a cool professor; he codes in class. He only spends ten percent of the time lecturing, and the rest he will tell you his stories. During offices hours, he is not available. Not recommended if you want to learn assembly language., Worst professor in CS department. He doesnt teach at all, have fun googling for hours.He is easy to get angry If you have questions.Homeworks are hard, no Hw solution.I would not recommend you guy take his class., Bad professor in SJSU, He doesnt teach anything.I would not recommnend you guy take his class, The spaciest dude I have ever met. Cant stay on topic to save his life. He is however, passionate and understands the subject thoroughly, but this doesnt come across well in the course. Grades were updated 3 times in an entire semester. I wouldnt recommend., Interesting character to say the least. Prone to spending the majority of class talking about unrelated material. Will usually blow you off if you ask him for help. Notes are full of errors. He rarely updates the grades. However, he is at least very enthusiastic about the material. Nice guy overall but consider other options if available..., In this class he doesnt use a book, he just expects you to program a lot. His tests are multiple choice with a few programming problems. What most people dont like about him is on his tests there are some questions where knowing the answer does not depend on your attending lecture as much as if you programmed out of class. I loved his class tho., PROS: very current, knowledgable, industry experience, curves grades, explains relevancy of material, lecturing style encourages student participation, emphasizes material that will help your career CONS: doesnt use texts; errors in demos/lectures/exams/notes/assignments; updates notes/assignments w/out notice; no solutions to assignments, His exams are difficult. I am getting a B though. I noticed this professor plays favorites. He always let his favorite student get away with disturbing him and is less harsh on them in class., The class is disjointed. Exam questions are irrelevant to HW. Notes are too brief, have fun Googling for hours. Does not provide feedback. Takes too long to return back exams, hw, and quizes. His TA grades the HW, so you will never get to shine because he doesn\t personally grade your code and seems to not care. No solutions for HW either., One of the best instructors at SJSU. Johnny is up to date with new technologies (unlike most of the faculty) and knows how the industry works. Great class if you already know some basic html/css/js. Study smart and have an interest for web development and you will learn what is needed to land a job at an internet company., worst professor of CS department. doesnt teach at all. just talks about his gf and france. expects you to do everything on your own. let us to read specifications and do huge vague project labs. take some one elses class, worst professor of all times. no feedback on assignments, horrible lectures, expects a lot of reading and coding, doesnt teach at all, dont curve and dont expect his help in doing assignments or hws. take Pollets class - same course contents., doesnt teach at all.no notes, no books, no feedback, no curve even if whole class going bad.expects a lot and makes you to read specifications which are useless and vague.doesnt teach any coding and still expects you to write complex coding in exams.worst professor, took no interest in checking assignments or helping students.never take his class, Hes very disorganized. He has stopped posting notes, and he just talks nonsense during class. He tests on code, but doesnt teach code, and his HW has vague descriptions. His expectations are way to high, infact its vague..., Horrible Professor.Students have to do everything on their own.Doesnt teach at all.Expects alot and huge assignments from students without teaching a single code.Dont ever take his class.Throw up everything like a fire hose.Finished HTML,XML,CSS,Javascript,jQuery,PHP,DOM,PostGres,XSLT,XPath in one month ie. 8 classes, Dont ever take his class. Always talks about his personal life and French culture.Useless lectures.HWs are huge and really hard.Make you to read specifications and manuals.Will not teach anything about programming and coding.Will ruin your interest in web development., Do attend the class. You will learn a lot from his lecture. He doesnt use the book much often, but hes lecture is crystal clear. He does has a lot of real world experience. Very helpful if you can chat with him after class, Johnny is great professor.He creates a great interest in learning the programming.He helps to understand the concept thoroughly.Tests are multiple choice questions with one or two program.If someone wants to learn java basics then attend this class., I couldnt imagine a better CS46A professor. I thank Johnny this professor for single handedly teaching me and 15 other students Java.  Martin lectures really well and shows you step by step examples of what he is talking about. He teaches you what you need to know to program in Java. You MUST take this professor., You will learn A LOT. Challenging, even for student with real-world experienced. But that what makes this class great, you are forced to THINK, not just do, but you have to do A LOT of coding on wide verity of languages, some you might never seen before., This is a very KEWL MAN. He wants to let everyone pass the class. But make sure study hard! His exams are tough even though they are just multiple choice questions. Make some buddies for homework assignments \cause you might not do by yourself. Martin is a smart guy and he works for Paypal...:) Go with his class now! I am trying to advertise him., No Comments, Very smart guy; tends to wing his classes as hes confident. Presents some very difficult programming problems and isnt afraid to require some serious knowledge from the students. Tests are multiple choice though, so even that theyre very detail focused theyre not that bad., Martin is the easiest prof for cs152. His exams and final are all Scantron multiple choice and are ridiculously easy. Programming assignments can be challenging, but he lets you work in groups so you can find someone smart to do all the work and just study for the exams. A really cool guy and makes lectures entertaining. He only teaches part time."
Navrati Saxena,/professor/2626481,4.2,85%,3.1,"Dr. Saxena is caring, kind, and easy to approach. I enjoyed her class as she understood that we had other upper-level STEM courses and she focused more on the theories than coding, which will be important once AI knows how to code. Also, Kalindi, the Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader, was amazing. Attending the SI sessions helped immensely., Kind and caring professor, lectures are engaging and she doesnt dwell on less important points. Always makes it clear why you learn each topic, and relates things back to succeeding in job interviews and the workforce. Enjoyed the class a lot, but be prepared as the exams make up a large part of the grade and you need to remember everything., Her slides are very good, and she cares about the material and if students fully understand or not what she demonstrates on the white board. Class has 5 homework assignments, and if you go by her slides and homework, her two quizzes, midterm, and final shouldnt be so bad, Professor Saxena was great. She taught the concepts very clearly and mostly focused on the concepts of DSA and not the coding applications. The tests were multiple choice/fill-in-the-blank but each point counts for 1% of your grade so it is easy to lose points unexpectedly. Some of her test questions were slightly unfair but SI made up for it., Professor Saxena is very kind. She is always willing to work with you to the best of her ability. Very approachable and has great lectures. Her slides are made really well and the concepts are properly explained. She also ensures she is at pace with the students and doesnt rush lectures. Class is more conceptual and she gives work field advice., The other reviews imply that shes fallen off but that couldnt be farther from the truth. She is genuinely one of the nicest professors I have ever taken. She does a good job explaining things, and if you are confused she will take time to go over it again to make sure you understand. Class is focused more on theory and you dont code too much., Im not sure whats up with all these ratings but Professor Saxena has been so kind. She is willing to do so much for her students like pausing during class for the information to process and letting students take pictures of the board. The tests make up most of your grade, but her tests are not that bad and she provides practice problems., She can be direct in class, which can be tough for students with social anxiety. Her grading lacks partial credit, making it challenging for those close to passing. She also covers material quickly, likely due to time constraints.\nI have understood the rules and I am following the guidelines. She was very moody and got pissed off most of time., Saxena was an easy professor when she was new to SJSU faculty. But over the years and semesters her reputation of multiple choice exams went down the drain. The class is next to impossible to get an A, You can pass for sure, but getting an A is difficult and this mostly just due to careless mistakes on exams. Exams are now fill in blank, no MC, I would avoid this professor. She is knowledgeable but extremely rude and condescending at times. Also she has  tendency to over plie and cram a lot of information like slides on students while the overall class is behind schedule according to syllabus. She made class more stressful than it already is. AVOID. Does not curve. Took her for CS158A., + Proessor Navratis teaching style is amazing. \n+ Easy homeworks; can also be submitted 3 time for a better grade. \n- The tests are difficult and are a major percentage of your grade.\n- 1 point in the class is equivalent to 1%. If you get 12/25 on the midterm, you lose about 13% of your final grade.\n- No curve.\n+ Professor is always available., Shes an OK professor and lecturer. She regularly goes off script and then says things that are wrong and when you ask questions she ignores you and tells you shes right. Does a lot of little things that are just her way of doing it. If you want to pass DSA shes a good choice, low homework. But her test questions are confusing and shes just ok., Her lectures were always super helpful and informative. Theres not too many hw assignments, mostly quizzes and the midterms. My only real complaint is that when I took her class she did not give any partial credit on exams, which lost me a lot of points., Her teaching is just an average quality. There are a few homeworks and exams are multiple choice based. She doesnt post any grade stats and usually releases grades pretty late. There are pros and cons to have multiple choice exams using Scantron (no partial credits) but its ok to get this difficult course done with less stress., Shes average. Lectures are alright, but generally just doesnt cover enough examples nor gives enough practice. BUT exam problems for the most part were pretty much similar to the examples she did go over. Each test/quiz problem is 1%, some 2% or 3% of your overall grade. No partial credit. HW is free tho., She is an amazing professor. Her grading was fairly genuine and neat. Her teaching is what matters the most, take it you will learn a lot from this class. Will recommend taking her class again., The best SJSU professor, really cares for her students. Explains the concepts really well, gives enough HW and keeps motivating you to do better. For a good grade, suggest to attend all the classes and follow in class instructions. Even allows resubmissions on HW. In all, the focus is on learning and not just grades. Will Highly recommend her., Lectures were great with clear, guided examples for each algorithm. Her quizzes were not too difficult if you just did the practice questions. Homework sometimes LeetCode questions and you could resubmit again until you got 100%., Awesome Professor, really cares for the students and takes effort to solve any doubt you may have. Took it in summer and so it looked like there would be less time to learn but she did an awesome job in explaining all the concepts. There are no regrades but she does give extensions and if you just follow through her lectures, you will surely excel, Idk what happen but her summer class Grades looks chaos. She explained lecture good, but her grading is very hard. No partial,extra credits or curve. A lot of us got destroyed with such a harsh grading and tough exam questions. She was good in online but very very hard in in person class. Would be nice if she atleast curve. If no alot of usll fail., Cares greatly about her students. For homework theres no hard deadline so you can turn them in late to a certain degree for full credit and resubmit until you get it right. No partial credit on exams/quizzes, quizzes for each module, midterm on first half of modules, final isnt cumulative (only second half of modules)., This Professor can really teach! Ive learned so much stuff in this class. HW was fairly easy. The quizzes on the other hand were difficult and this is also due to the fact that every points is worth 1 percent of your total overall grade. Shes becoming more challenging as she teaches in-person now., Unlimited revisions on homework, easy lectures. As long as you show up you will get an A., Her #1 priority in the class is making her slides/explanations as SIMPLE as possible. She will go over the concepts many time so that nobody is confused. The environment in her class makes it very easy for the students to succeed/get good grades., Professor Saxena is amazing and by far one of my favorite professors at SJSU. She makes it her goal that students understand the material thoroughly by slowly introducing new concepts and explaining them in an easy-to-understand way. If you are ever confused, dont be afraid to ask. She will always go out of her way to help you until you get it., Professor Saxena is easily the most understanding professor I have ever had. Not only is she kind but she is very good at teaching the material. There is quite a bit to learn in the class but she makes it as easy as possible while also giving all the information. If you have a choice for CS 146 choose her., Shes a great professor and very caring, probably the best 146 prof., Professor Saxena is one of the best professors in the CS department. Lecture is very easy, and always open to feedback for her lectures. One midterm and final with a few homework and quizzes that are very manageable. She also invited guest lecturers at the end of the semesters to tell us the importance of algorithms. Wont regret taking her., Professor Saxena is legit the nicest professor. This was her first-semester teaching but she explained each topic clearly and slowly. It is easy to understand and if you dont you always have youtube. She has a couple of quizzes over lockdownbrowser and homework (no coding req) but its pretty easy as long as you study for it., Professor Saxena is the best CS teacher a student could ask for. Her lectures are very clear, you can tell she really cares, and shes available outside class. When I came to her for help, she gave me the encouragement to keep going and offered what help she could give. If you have the chance to, enroll with Professor Saxena., Absolutely amazing professor. She genuinely cares about her students doing well and gives so many opportunities for her to help you. I just dont like her grading system. About 90% of your grade is based on quizzes and exams, which can make it a little scary but dont worry, her class is def easy if you pay attention!, I am currently taking her class, and she is one of the best professors Ive had in CS classes! She really cares her students, always offering for help, and she encourages students to ask questions in her lecture. Her tests are very reasonable. If you do homework and study, it should be fine. I am always excited to attend her lectures!"
Sin-Min Lee,/professor/226533,2.2,N/A,2.6,"He doesnt teach but if you like sjsu students to give amateur lectures for each class, then this is a class for you.  But be warned, more than half of the students there dont speak fluent english neither. so pick your poison., This guy is crazy, and I mean CRAZY. Impossible to understand lectures, just a horrible teacher if he can even be called that.  He simply just doesn\t know how to teach, everything you learn will be from YOU learning it, not from him. I wish the best of luck to anyone taking a class with him, I got a B and I really am not sure how., Boring lectures. He doesnt explain the concept very clearly, but expects students know it all. Good thing: he gives many extra credits ,and you dont want to miss these chances. Quiz every other day, but I like it because it makes me read and learn the lecture slides. Final is optional if you earn good grade on midterms. No textbook is required., Most of the reviews reflect how this prof teach.  I took RDBMS with him in the 80s and  did not learn anything.  I have to re-learn the database on my own.  I think it will do justice to the students if he just retire and let new faces do the teaching. Just my $0.02 cents, Lee is not as easy as he looks. He gives a quiz every other day. Midterms were not to difficult, as half the questions are multiple choice. However, he only gave one hw (which was hard) and made it worth 15% of the entire course grade, which ended up screwing over a lot of ppl. His final was super hard. The book is useless, just study his slides., If planning to take this track CS 157A&B and u want good grades then go with Lee for both the classes. Covers what is needed but his teaching style is not that great. Reads from ppt slides and makes students understand the concepts by repeating the same thing again and again. Conclusion: If you want good grade then Lee is the guy., If youre a self-starter, youll learn a lot from the lecture slides and do well for this class. The class web page which covers essential course materials is very helpful for me. He does explain important algorithms in class and make sure students understand and very helpful during office hours as well., DONT DO IT! U wont learn anything. He cant teach... he was supposed to retire but I dont know wtf hes still doing here. Hes like 80% blind... 1/2 the time he talks about irrelevant stuff. You have to learn on your own... total waste of an education.. no wonder people say SJSU CS dept sucks, when you have professors like him, pretty laid back class. expects you to learn by your own. regular quizzes keeps your aware. dont really care who grades the tests, as long as you do it correctly, you earn the points. dont have to buy the book if you are not afraid of missing any require knowlegdes cover from CHs but not in class. 3 easy midterms,1 presentation+group project+exam., No Comments, The worst prof at SJSU. Does not arrive prepd to lecture. Gives excuses of eye prob. ARBITRARY grading on quizzes/exams by STUDENTS (no grader) spent 10 HOURS on VAGUE assignment (NO details EVER given) just to have UNMOTIVATED STUDENT grade it. hOrRiBle lecture, then quizzes u RIGHT after! Just Lazy! PLEASE Stay away!!! From an A+ 157A student!!!, An OK class,the professor makes one learn by having regular quizzes in the class and mainly by practicing.Quizzes are real tough but account for only 10% of the grade.HWs and presentation are quite straight forward.Gives extra credit so one can recover.Went over fast for topics like SQL,Relational calculus but normalization was covered well., nice guy, but unclear and unorganize. you have to depend on and learn the material by yourself outside class. you need to prepare for pop quizzes (10%) that is given out almost every class and 3 midterms (30%)through out the semester. Hard to get good grades., Good Heart! And Easy to get a good grade!, hes unclear but hes a nice person. Lots of extra credit opportunity. :), This guy is just crazy. He teaches us a buncha stuff then tests us on something totally different. The book is totally useless. Sometimes he tells us stories out of the blue that go off on some wild tangent. His grading system is just insane(partial credit on multiple choice?)The only way i passed was to do load of extra credit. Avoid at all costs., agreeably difficult teacher, lectures are often unclear, book is NOT required, programs are easy if you are a decent programmer. the key to the class is to read the lecture slides yourself and to do lots of extra credit. very good willed teacher, but sometimes a pain. final is optional in some cases, WORST teacher ever, claimed to have Parkinsons. Midterms, lectures, and quizes are all irrelevant. Lecture notes and programming assignment  s are taken from other univs. Plagiarism. Do not buy the textbook as it will never be used in class., Good Heart!  And Easy to get a good grade!, tough tough professor, doesnt teach very well....but allows extra credit for screw ups.... midterms are not relevant to lectures... dont recommend, Prof. with a good heart.  EXTREMELY unorganized.  Not a good teacher to learn from, tends to be confusing. very approachable outside of class.  Plenty of quizes to keep you aware., Very helpful and approachable outside of class, programs are a bit challenging but you can resubmit for a better grade, student presentations helped enhence class concepts., true: unorganize, not clear on lecture, lots of program. What you dont know: he curves, if you do some extra credit easy stuff(like grading, simply research) ull pass. deep down nice guy wants to stuff as much stuff into students as possible. easy class, doesnt like to teach anything.  most of the time you are learning from your classmates.  Grades you as if he is teaching your lots of stuff.  When he does decide to teach, its usually hard to follow. Tells too many unuseful stories., No Comments, Learn nothing, Very confusing teacher. Expect to learn everything on your own. Plagorizes other notes for his lectures then tells stupid stories. Past his time, he should retire., HORRIBLE. No one in the class could follow his lectures, which often do not correspond to the many quizes we had. HE SHOWED NO CONCERN to the students. He just wanted us to help him with his research for extra credit, which however did not help the grades, He is ok.  Some of his program assignments were based on his own personal variation of class topics.  Unfortunately his English is not so good and it can be a pain to understand sometimes.  I thought he was friendly and he made funny jokes., I you want to work after graduation, never register his classes., If you speak Chinese, hell be much softer on you once you speak in Chinese. The book is good; so if you read it, you can learn a lot. Tests and quizzes are randome material so the better you are a logic, the better your chances."
Soon Tee Teoh,/professor/630528,4.2,88%,3.1,"Probably one of the best options for 147. Its a tough class no matter what, but he explains the concepts very well. Homework and practice exams prepare you for the exams and everything felt fair, plus it was open notes so no need to memorize little details. Only downside is the harsh grading scale (you need a 96 for an A and a 92 for an A-)., Great teaching style, cares about subject, very interesting to watch, explains things in an understandable and clear way, knowledgeable, reasonable homework assignments and tests. Highly appreciated industry knowledge he gave. One thing is that his lecture slides dont have all the information you need, Teoh is amazing at teaching CS 147. 147 can be a difficult subject, but Teoh is extremely capable of explaining every concept in a digestible manner. His slides are very concise and provide a very clear summary of the lectures. Tests are open notes, like the homework but with a curveball question. 100% recommended. A is a 96% min, strict grading., The course is well designed and lectured. I have had a better understanding about the whole picture of computer Architecture after taking this course. He explains concepts logically and clearly. Would take his course again, The professor was great, however tests were hard. Homeworks were long. 96% for an A. Solid option for challenger!, Slides are not the nicest, but is pretty good at explaining. Caring and tries to answer as many questions as possible and to be thorough when going over HW and tests. Extended several due dates with no penalty and, though class def got harder after EZ 1st test, seems that he was less harsh grading final. HW can be easily aced. Need > 96% for an A., Solid choice. Explains concepts generally well. HW is doable and not time-consuming, but having a class Discord gc helps a lot. Exams are similar to HW and study guides but with a few changes. I felt it got progressively harder after the 1st exam, and HW and exams reflected this. Tough grading scale (A- is 95.99) so you have little room for error., Very good professor. Take his class!, The class itself is useless in learning game programming. Teoh almost entirely focuses on uselessly specific 3d constructs skipping over 2d. No actual programming taught. You can get 100% on all of your home programming projects, but still get a low grade because of the incongruous exams asking painfully specific 3D math. Take Linear Algebra first!, Fairly tough class and Teoh does the best he can to teach it primarily to CS majors who are not as used to dealing with the hardware side. Interesting material but I felt Teoh went way too fast in lecture, making it almost impossible to keep up with everything hes covering. Tests and hw were straight from lecture material. Dont miss lectures!, Excellent prof, and kindhearted guy. Knows his graphics programming and speaks with authority on advanced topics in graphics programming. He requires you to demo your code to him to make sure you understand it but this is actually very beneficial. Its a chance to receive feedback on how to improve it. Not many professors care enough to do that., Very clear, inspiring and challenging presentation of material. Total of two midterms and a final exam. 5 homework assignments, none of which are programming assignments. On the other hand, he likes to end lectures early, 30 to 15 min. This time could be spent more productively. Otherwise, very positive experience. Recommended., One of the best young professors at SJSU. Hes always prepared, very methodical. I also take 116A. Got As in both classes. He made them easy and enjoyable., Dr. Teoh is a great Professor. The course is rather hard, but his lectures is very clear and helpful. Quizzes, midterms, and final are totally coverred by lectures and study guides. Take his class!, The subject is tough, but Teoh makes it easier to understand.  He is very accommodating to all of the students.  Exams are straight from the lecture notes, but that doesnt help much since the subject is so difficult.  Go to every class.  You dont want to miss anything since it may show up on the exam and only covered on that one day., Very good teacher.  Clear lectures.  Answers questions well.  Fun homework assignments.  Easy to learn and I learned a lot in his class.  Midterms and final are not easy, but they are very straight-forward.  Just study a bit and you will be fine.  I recommend taking any of his classes., Awesome teacher! He is there for you to learn. He is very thorough with his slides and his examples. Hell even wait for you write down what is on the board before continuing. His midterms and final are fair because this is a somewhat medium/hard subject. Always attend! Youll never know what youll miss......, Really nice guy.  Lectures are easy to understand given you have a good understanding of math(you should this is CS).  Projects are helpful.  Good teacher considering the material he teaches is fairly difficult at times., Lectures are organize and clear.  Homework and Exams are not so bad.  I would take any of the class he is teaching., I like this instuctor because he is so clear about what he expects from students.  He is very organized and professional and he sets you up to succeed., A great professor!  Clear, concise, and organized.  His midterms draw heavily on the review sheets he gives you, so no real surprises, especially if you pay attention in class.  Pay attention, do the homework, study the review sheet, and youll be fine., Very organized and straight-forward teacher. There are no surprises, no curve balls. He clearly presents what you need to know without nonsense. Young and yet one of the few proper teachers of the generally mediocre SJSU CS staff., Good teacher. Very clear and straightforward in explaining everything. Your grade in his 147 is dependent on how much work you put into it - so study a lot, especially for his tests., You learn as much as you want to in Teohs class.  His lectures are succinct and to the point, and hes a friendly dude.  While the bare minimum requirements for any project are pretty easy to meet, it takes an often substantial amount of time to invest to get all the bonus points.  Tests can be rough, but arent bad if you go over lecture notes., Sure, I beleive he is very considerate, and thats why 69.5 and you will get a D+. His tests are freaking hard. Doesnt know how to make a exam question. He made the final too long and thats why gave 20% boost up in one sec and another sec 10%. No matter how much he knows about the subject, he needs to know how to make ques.., Has good command of English language, unlike a few profs in the CS department.  The lectures are very clear and organized, and his online notes are very helpful too.  Some assignments and exams are tough, but hes quite reasonable in his expectations. Returns graded tests and homework promptly., He *does* throw a lot of info at you, but lectures are online and contain excellent images/code (look them up yourself!). The painfulness of the project comes mostly from debugging the awkward glut code. Tests are difficult, but more math vs memorization - and he offers decent EC to curve. Books useless for coding hw - youre better off googling., Very clear, understandable, honest and fair professor. Its obvious he really understands the material, and hes good at conveying it. His lectures are usually also easy to sit through, he talks like a normal person and can be pretty funny., This guy surely knows a lot, except how to teach.  He just throws the ball to you and how to deal with it is your business.  Two easy homeworks followed by a 3D project that has nothing to do with previous hws make you lost in that matrix world. If you do want to this this class, be very good at math and read the text throughly(not a good book), Dont take his class. Projects are very hard. Exams are sucks. Book is also very bad. Give questions which you will have no idea from where to study. He does not care how students are doing in the class., What a great professor!  He is very funny and understanding.  He definitely helped me learn the subject material!  Great Teacher! Highly Recommended!"
Teng Moh,/professor/660443,2.3,13%,3.7,"The rudest professor at SJSU. Does not care about the students; does not respond to emails. Unethical and unprofessional behaviors. Unfortunately, he has a monopoly for CS 190 class., Very rude towards student. Dont help you in understanding concepts. Dont take his class., Dropped 247 on the first day\n\nFacts: \n1. Doesn\t have canvas, the website was down\n2. He says People nowadays get offended so easily\n3. He mentioned Master and Salve when talking something about the master\s program\n4. He uses childbirth as an analogy for the prerequisite. It goes like one woman 10 months but no 10 women 1 month, (CS274)Never take this professor!! Hes not a good teacher, does not care about students success. Even if you go to his office hours, he will derail from what you asked, he never gives a proper answer to your question. For the project, he gives limited set of research papers to choose and you need to replicate the project shown in research paper., Beware!! Extremely moody!! No feedback at all. Expects us to conduct research and publish new algorithms in a span of 1 month., When Tengo Moh was born his parents reaction must have been what a disappointment. This professor finds great pleasure in creating an hostile environment for students and deliberately makes learning difficult by his unclear teaching skills. Avoid at all costs. Professor should be fired cannot teach even if his own life was on the line. Disgraceful., A moody teacher, spends lots of time talking about proposals in class instead of giving them back with actual grades and comments. Like even the positive reviews mentions course goals and grading are very ambiguous. we dont know our grades throughout the semester. I was also warned by a couple of friends not to take his course., Never grade and give homework back. In the whole semester, you will only know your midterm score. I was warned by my friends that he give score unfair before take his class, and it turns out to be true., Funny guy. Super-friendly, super-patient. He is really there for the students, especially the students who love CS. The quality of his instruction is proportional to how engaged you are as a student, hes probably the most student-responsive prof Ive had. You need to be self-motivated, as goals and grading are very ambiguous. Good guy+professor., If youre self-motivated, youll learn a lot and do well. Ive taken many courses with Dr. Moh, most notably, machine learning and distributed computing; hes knowledgeable and passionate in these areas. If youre struggle, come see him during office hours; hes very understanding. He is honest and sincere about helping his students succeed., DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS if you really want to learn something! He cannot give explanation for the grade that he gives - doesnt even grade all your work so there is no feedback. He SLEEPS when the students give presentations. He randomly gives grades, and there are no published stats to figure out where you stand., I personally prefer Dr. Mohs teaching style, practical teaching materials and textbooks selections, and encouraging lectures. Students must study the materials and do hands-on course-work...and that is good. I took more than two classes from Dr. Moh and got all As. Thanks to Dr. Moh and those who teach evening classes., You basically have to learn everything on your own. All he does is try to explain whats printed in the book exactly as the book does. Cant ask questions because he makes things more confusing. Unclear expectations, but he tries to make up for it my manipulating grades. Haha for the last post, I did catch him sleeping through my presentation., He is very moody. Sleeps through the project presentations, so God knows how he grades the projects., A nice guy but a terrible teacher. Doesnt grade or return homework. Doesnt seem interested in the subject. Tons of reading, little guidance about whats important., Overall, the course was quite useful. We used the Stanford book DB Systems: The complete book and covered chap11-17. Last 2 weeks were for student presentations of their term projects. Exams tested you on whether you understood the concepts, so you can\t just memorize the material. The work load was avg for a grad-level CS class., This teacher demands that you learn by reading over 400 pages for each midterm on your own.Good luck passing this class, cause thats the only way you will[no matter how hard you work].He has quizes on subjects that you have not even learned yet,and you do not know what you receive on those quizes until you receive your grade.Its his way or  no way., Moh isnt so bad.  He can be funny, and his last segment (parallel processing) is where he shines.  He usually teaches straight out of the book.  Tests are killer = timed programming midterms.  Make sure your laptops primed with old code unless you think you can finish a program in 90 minutes from scratch...  And do the extra credit (+5% to grade), Not that bad at all. His test was hard. I scored above 80... not sure its luck or what but I tried to study very hard on the textbook and his note. By the way, hes very helpful during his office time. Ive been buging him every time and understood more about the materia being covered. Highly recommended for selflearners., Look at his class this way: quizzes are ahead of whats being covered. No ****ion for homework whatsoever. No study guide for test which forced you to study 2-3 chapters 200-300 pages long. Tests focused on questions with no right or wrong answer (and right answer would have to match his answers). GG sucker, He knows nothing to teach. He doesnt know how to teach. He cant explain things. He doesnt know how to grade stuff. Sloppy, lazy, loudsy., Very goofy, very funny, and very nice. Lenient grader. Not very clear in explaining the material, and the book was just bad, to my taste. Consult some other books, websites. And, take time to clearly understand each pattern. Class is very do-able, if you put in enough effort. But of course, some people take 4 or 5 classes at the same time. Spread!, He is a tough teacher because cs 151 is tough class. Easy going and helpful , should know java before even thinking about taking this class., Like he said, he really didnt want to teach this class, but was assigned anyway.  And it showed., Hard class, he may give you the impression hell be a hard professor in the beginning, but youll see he turns out to be a pretty lenient grader.  And hes actually pretty nice when you talk to him, be ready to put some effort in his class. He shows interest in helping students..and hates microsoft (if that in anyway, helps anyone..), very hard class... but this guys a good teacher. theres alotta freedom with the assignments.  the class isnt that bad though... u get what u put in it.  those who struggle simply dont try in his class.  the lectures arent very interesting, but he loves questions and helps u a lot., this is the dictionary for this class.\n keep in mai  (mind)\n beeecos      (because)\n eeef         (if)\n rai          (right)\n all-rai      (alright)\n midten       (midterm)\n ooKay        !!!\n elise        (at least)\n birs         (birth)\n proben       (problem)\n banews       (bad news)\n diffence     (difference)\n mechanisen   (mechanism)\n swim"
Loc Lam,/professor/2548623,4.4,78%,2.3,"He is one of the best, if not the best, professorsa very well-structured class with great lectures. His projects are good, and exams are kind of hard, but he gives review questions, which makes it easier to pass. Overall great guy. Take him without any hesitation., Prof is nice and approachable but flies through lecture slides & doesnt post slides or notes so its hard to study on your own aside from textbook. Can retake your first exam and theres extra credit. Review questions are very similar to exam which is really helpful. I passed but Im not sure how much I actually learned., I cant use the word to describe his kindness. He will help you with all the problems you are facing in or outside the class. He will also give an extension for the project if asked. 2 midterms drop the lowest one. Final exam similar to the final review. Funny Professor in sjsu ever. Dont think too much just take his class and no regret., CMPE30 with Professor Lam was a super easy A or A+, just review the lectures and practice. Review questions are similar if not the same as the exam itself, and class projects and labs were not so bad. He also drops lowest midterm so if you screw up the first midterm you have another chance to shine the second time, making the class easy after all., Literally the easiest class at this school. I dont know how you can get less than an A in this class unless you cant read, cant type, or are chronically sleep-deprived and depressed because you got dumped by your online e-kitten last month., Good lectures, one midterm & a midterm retake (takes the highest score of the two). Weekly quizzes and multiple choice questions on exams. 1 EC project near the end of the term as well. Hes very nice and helpful for learning C., Hes so nice! Exams were taken on lockdown browsers on your personal laptop. Lectures were a bit confusing at times. Easy to get in contact with. Homework assignments were average- not extremely difficult. Definitely recommend!, Professor Loc Lam really cares for his students and wants them to pass with the best grade possible. Midterms are similar to review sessions, easy class as long as you pay attention and attend lectures., You WILL do badly the first time you take the midterm, but thats OK. The class averages over the years tended to be around the 40-60s. But he will let you retake the midterm, so take the opportunity to go over what you did wrong. He will often give extensions for projects if asked; projects can be hard though was probably a skill issue for me., He is great and knows what he is teaching. I had no prior experience but he made the course easy to follow and I learned how to code in C. There will be labs every week. So get prepared to work! His test review sessions are very helpful for the test as they are very similar to them. He will also give a make-up test before the final. I recommend him, Weekly quizzes, good lecturer, very lenient on deadlines and will extend if you need more time. Allowed one midterm retake and extra credit project., His class seems very difficult and he seems pretty intimidating at first but his class is very easy to pass and is very approachable for help. The class is very test heavy but they are mostly multiple choice and fill in the blank so a few days of studying is enough to do well on them. He also gives a retake midterm and drops the lowest one., He is awesome! Lectures are fast but effective. One mid-term, which can be retaken. Lab assignments and quiz are every week, which is hectic but very helpful to understand the materials. Make sure to do them, because it helps a lot for the tests. He also gives extra credit before finals which is very helpful to raise your grade. I recommend him!, pretty easy, weekly quizzes, 2 midterms (he drops ur lowest score), goes over midterm & final questions in the review he does the day the exams, randomly takes attendance but his lectures are worth it, Flies through the slides expecting you to understand them and doesnt upload the slides. When class failed the midterm, he refused to curve and had us retake it again in which average was still low. ASM is difficult and he doesnt explain concepts well. 4 projects and the extra project was tough if you dont know C. Was willing to extend deadline., 1 online canvas quiz per chapter. None of them were particularly hard as long as you read the chapter. 1 midterm(1 possible retake), and final. Both were fairly difficult and reviewing the tests was not available for most students. He had a pretty strong accent. Around 4 coding assignments. He gave an extra credit assignment. He will help if asked., The prof teaches quite well and we work on a lot of the projects in class during lecture. The exams are closed note and on lockdown browser in class so you have to be very good with the material to do well. He allowed a midterm retake because of how low scores were. Also his ta takes months to grade projects, This Professor teaches better than any other Professors who teaches cmpe102. But however, his exams are very difficult and hw/projects and pretty fair. He takes roll calls making attendance mandatory as it reflects your total grade. I would recommend him., He is very understanding and supportive towards his students! Take him you wont regret it., There are only a few programming assignments, a final project and a final exam. Put a lot of effort on the project. Make sure to actively take notes and review for each lecture for the final exam. If you really want to learn, program miniprojects for the concepts taught in class so you are prepared for the exam. If you do these, you will succeed, Pals, this professor is pretty awesome. He teaches you real things that you need in the real industries. Take notes, they are very useful even outside school. For sure he is funny and respectful. Just show your respect back by coming to the class, taking notes, and asking questions. You will definitely get an A then., Hes a good professor. 3-4 programming assignments and a final group project that he goes over well in class. Also a written Final that is comprehensive, but fair. Cares about you doing well in the class. Is helpful when asking for help."
Sayma Akther,/professor/2926663,2.9,45%,2.6,"This is a great professor.  Make sure you have some study habit developed for the class (as with all other courses) and you will be fine., This professor puts a lot of effort into teaching students CS correctly.  This class is for syntax, and it also teaches how future CS classes will be - you need to have initiative and learn on your own as well as in class.  This was by far a very easy class, but if you find it hard, just know that it is not the class that is the issue., Amazing professor.  Easy class, just takes the same amount of effort any average CS class would.  100% should take her, the other reviews must be venting for poor performance (which frankly is a personal issue)., Avoid her at all costs! Otherwise take at CC! \nNot nice\nLectures rushed, hard to grasp key concepts\nLack of engagement outside of class\nNever responds to emails\nAttendance is strictly monitored, roll-call system, need to be extra attentive so that you are marked present. \nFinal exam unrelated to the material\nExtremely low average\nNo curves, Avoid. Speeds through lectures, didnt know materials for the final exam (copied from ap cs), exam was out of syllabus, refuses to curve (despite a D average on final). Questions had typos (refused to fix). Doesnt answer emails., Speeds through lectures so make sure you take pictures of slides. The learning speeds up really fast, so maybe try learning java before taking the class. Retook my midterm and it was so much harder than the original. Shes nice but midterms are all on paper and you need to write code out without checking it., Kind and caring professor, however speeds through lecture slides. You will spend more time copying code down during participation exercises. Reading quizzes and two long homework assignments outside of class which are not difficult. Some questions not taught on exams. Fairly easy to get an A in. Not the worst professor, but not the best either., Easy class, however I have a lot of complaints. She has no presence in the class, she marked me absent for no reason THRICE and I lost 9 points for it. And especially this: she gave a question of a topic on the midterm that she NEVER taught at all. I spend most of my time in class copying code. Not the worst prof, but I def wouldnt take her again., Very very nice teacher, possibly the nicest Ive ever had. However thats where it ends, she teaches in an implicit way assuming you have prior knowledge to the subject (which I didnt) and most of class is spent copying the code she wrote on the board for participation exercise. Textbooks can be accessed online. Simple class, Wouldnt take again., She is a nice person, but teaching is not at that level. I had to watch online videos or some other sources to understand content. Grading was lenient and curve is applied to exams if class average is low. There is a group project that runs all semester long. If you know python, group project will be easy for you., Overall okay. Lecture slides are good. Participation is copy examples than hands-on coding. syllabus has not much info. Prof. is kind/understanding but softspoken. The grader grades all, scores can be negotiated. exam qs can be unclear, only 3 hw for practice.  If u have CS experience, attend every class, + seek extra practice, this class is for u., Teacher has absolutely no presence in the class, her teaching consists of showing code on the board and making students copy them down. And the midterm will be much more difficult the. What we went over in class, good luck!, She is never a punctual professor. She always comes in at least ten minutes late to lecture. On top of that, she speaks so soft that people in the back can barely hear. It does not help that she moves around the classroom too when lecturing, so not all of us can hear her., great teacher and does care for you, but the main issue is that she has inexperience when it comes to writing tests and listening to student feedback. She is a good person but not a great teacher., Took during her first semester. It is clear that she cares about her students success. If you have any idea how the field of CS works, you will greatly appreciate her coursework. It is a great intro for beginners. I brought prior coding knowledge to the course. If you are a CS major and cant do this course, consider switching to something else., Professor Akther is one of the best CS professors you could get.  Take her class - if you are not catastrophically lazy, unmotivated, or incapable, this course should only pose a moderate level of difficulty. \n\nRemember: CS does not get easier from here - if you cannot do 46A with Professor Akther, consider changing your major., Often late to classes. Attendance doesnt matter. Easy A. One midterm, but no final exam, just a project., Lectures barely covered the material, had to read from textbook to understand better. Activities basically just copying her code, wasnt helpfully in understanding the material. Only 2 homework, some of the questions had stuff we didnt learn yet. If you have previous coding experience you should be fine. Her first semester, hopefully gets better., Lectures were light and not in depth. The activities she gave during lectures sometimes forced everyone to scramble for the answer and you wouldnt really learn. Homework sometimes had super hard problems for no reason. \n\nFall 2023 was her first semester teaching so hopefully it gets better from here and all her problems change., Well, the class was for CS 46A, and it was quite literally one of the worst and directionless teachers Ive had in a while. It seems all over the place, doesnt prepare people, especially beginners, much for coding as lack of help is provided and its a chore to understand and process the lectures. The only reason I passed was my prior knowledge."
Faranak Abri,/professor/2824127,4.1,81%,2.8,"Lectures were very educational. There were a total of 2 midterms (each worth 20%) and a final (worth 25%). There was a lot of hw on Zybooks, which for the most part was easy, but also annoying. The professor gives out a lot of extra credit opportunities (max of 5%). The lab section was alright but it can be a little confusing sometimes., Good at lecturing but its really up to you to be engaged or not. Midterms are definitely difficult and no practice exam provided (unlike prof. tsao). Hw is also difficult and long. Offers lots of extra credit. Better lecturer than tsao but tsao provides similar practice exams, may be easier to get a better grade in his class., Pay attention to the in class activities she uses them in midterms/tests. no actual study guides which is sad, Dr. Abri is truly one of the best professors. Her lectures are extremely informative, and the tests are great.  Even if you are not super happy with your score, theres a lot of extra credit for those who go the extra mile to learn & understand the concepts. Great lectures, generous grading, and an overall wonderful class. 100% take her if you can., Sweetest teacher. 2 midterms, a lab exam/multiple choice. Lectures are loaded with info, but due to time constraints she glazes over some important topics. Dont have to attend lecs, but she gives bonus points for attending sometimes. 5-10% grade cushion if youre struggling. lets TAs teach some concepts, if u have tanmay hes the goat, Great lectures, though it sucks that you have to pay for zybooks because thats what she used, but as long as you understand the assignments this class should be a breeze, but unfortunately I had poor study habits that semester., The professor is difficult to score better and gives alot of homework.Its difficult to clear this class., No need to bother showing up to class (its optional) zybooks will teach you all the content. The first 2 weeks have a massive workload but the rest is ok. The worst parts are the tests that just have you regurgitate mostly useless info and have no curving (despite massive failure)., Easy class and gives lots of extra credit. Overall does a good job teaching, though some times she can be convoluted. I found her accent to be tough sometimes, but she seems like a nice person., She is explaining the course subjects in an easy way. Giving bonus points up to 5%. Midterms are from the lectures and in class activities. Lab exams are coding questions with acceptable complexity., Mostly learned through zyBook assignments, more than her lectures. Dont procrastinate on zyBook assignments, they could be a lot to do in one night. Exams were mostly multiple choice, not really coding questions. Will provide mock exams for the 2 midterms, they could be useful for actual midterm, some questions are the same., Super easy if you understood 46A  / CSA. Practice exams were VERY similar. Homework is easy but annoying. Super clear slides and textbook, you can definitely skip lectures if confident. Mandatory lab component is easy but does take time off your Friday. Lot of extra credit opportunities (5% max). She is very kind and lots of TAs to help as well., Professor Abri is a kind and friendly professor. She cared about her students and tried her best for everyone to get a high grade in the class. The midterms were fair enough and they covered the materials in her slides with the in-class activities. 5% extra credit is given based on participation and others. Would highly recommend taking her class., If you did good in 46a or any related course this class should be a free A. Didnt go to a single lecture besides the first one when she told us attendance wasnt mandatory. All the learning is through zybooks. A low effort class but still make sure you understand what youre learning. Free 10% extra credit, OK Lecturer but easy to get a satisfying grade. Gives LOTS of extra credit opportunities and its a free 10% onto your grade, also grades pretty generously on the free response parts of the exams. Also isnt too strict and pretty lenient about issues that can come up during the semester, and gave a good amount of homework extensions, An okay professor compared to the other professors in the CS department. Gives lots of extra credit opportunity, homework pretty long sometimes, midterms are hard to study for as she doesnt provide much guidance and her lectures are either ridiculously straightforward or convoluted and confusing. Be prepared to teach yourself some things., Very nice professor, lenient on extensions and offered a lot of extra credit opportunities. The class used an online textbook that we would use during class and labs. Only complaint is I wish we would have done more coding on Eclipse, I felt that the lectures were rather textbook heavy. Overall a very good class and professor., Prof. Abri is excellent. I did CS 286 - Advanced Topics in CS under her this Fall. But the course code is not listed on RMP. She gives a lot of opportunities to somehow show her that you are interested in her course to get credit. Would highly recommend if you are into Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing. You learn beyond the syllabus., Pretty good professor. She tries her best, offers lots of extra credit and often asks for feedback. The lectures are pretty decent, and most exam questions are pretty similar to the homework., I believe this is her first year teaching and she got a pretty big lecture class. Very nice teacher who cares about her students. We had a discord and she would ask us if we need an extension as there is a lot of homework assignments. Overall, good class and good professor., Tons of extra credit opportunities. Also gave class-wide homework extensions, and tests are only on what was taught in class. Easy to contact via discord/email. Uses the textbook as the primary source for lecture info and teaches slow enough for most people to understand."
Jenny Lam,/professor/2190672,2.3,28%,4.2,"I dont get why so many people struggle... maybe because they dont show up and dont ask questions. Be a proactive learner and youll succeed., Great!, I think professor Lam may have gotten off to a rough start - shes a new teacher after all. This year was pretty good though. The tests were easier than what I expected based on the lectures. It really seemed she cared that we learned the overarching concepts. If you dont understand in lectures, go to office hours. Shes brilliant one-on-one., Got a 100 on CS46B and CS46A Final, Approach teacher takes is super confusing. Would not recommend taking this class unless you have a lot of time to do self studying., She will seem nice in the first instance but as the semester progresses, you will start hating the class because it gets so boring. There are way better choices out there so utilize your school time wisely. Good luck!, Professor needs to clear her concepts before teaching. She can never answer students when they ask questions. ALWAYS her reply will be shell get back to that question after FINDING OUT and she will never GET BACK. Her class is a torture. Not recommended at all!, I would say this is the toughest class I have ever taken. The professor looks cute though LOL., Medium difficulty. Dont listen to the other students whining. The class is super passable, just do your homework and study., Avoid this professor!  Run as fast as you can!!  She looks nice but somehow changes to another person when grading papers. To me, it is okay to have those irrelevant lecture topics and HW Qs. The worst thing is that she does NOT know how to explain things clear, the only thing she does is trying to confuse you.  Be prepared to learn by yourself., Didnt explain things well. Lecture, homework and exams are irrelevant. Good person but Bad teacher, NOT recommand., Nice person but not good teacher. NOT recommended. Lectures  useless.  Slides  confusing. Homeworks  confusing, hard and lightly similar to what taught in lecture. Tests  hard, tough grader.  Conclusion: Take any other professor if possible., Dont ever take this Professor if you want to learn. She is so confused all the time!! I can already feel Im gonna struggle in future classes because i dont understand what she teach. Good luck if you are stuck with her., Professor Lam seems unprepared for lecture.  She spends too much of the short class time either writing out non-essential text, erasing and rewriting, or frozen while she thinks about what to say / do next.  Her exams arent too difficult. Just make sure you study what youre supposed to know and there wont be any curve balls / trick questions., She is a good teacher for actually learning the subject, but a vary bad choice if you desire a good grade.  Tests/quizes are graded harshly and what few extra credit opportunities exist are limited to improving the minuscule homework section of your grade., Worst professor ever. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone. The material is irrelevant and important topics were not covered in the class. Professor is unable to explain anything well. Lecture notes are very disorganized., Avoid this class at all cost. There is no learning in this class and the exams are too hard. Teacher assigns so many readings that are impossible to do and the lecture is not organized. The material is interesting if taught in a good manner but professor makes it too boring and is harsh with grading., Professor Lams lectures are not relevant to the syllabus. I will not recommend her., Dr. Lam is the worst instructor that I have ever seen. The things that she should improve: class notes, assignments, exams, clear explanation. Her class notes are the worst. She dont even grade assignments in time. She ask students to use Piazza, however, she take too long to reply on any post. I would not take her again."
Angus Yeung,/professor/2021381,3.0,43%,3.8,"Awesome prof! He has extensive industry knowledge which makes his insight interesting and worth hearing. Hes humorous; likes coming to class, even on a Saturday. Its not one of those classes where you just learn BS CS concepts that u feel will never get applied. After this class, a student is ready to take on an entry-level mobile engineering role, I wish he can just jump into the coding area and explain the abstract concept while coding. Nobody will understand the concept without real examples, so its kind of wasting of time. Learning how to code in Android Studio is the point.., Good professor. Does examples in class, but you have to teach most of it yourself. Lots of reading, homework is hard and time consuming, and the class average on the exams was a D. He grades mostly based on programming assignments, as I got a D avg on both exams but an A- in the class. Some extra credit. Dont take if you have a loaded schedule., A great professor, humorous, knowledgeable. His ppt lecture is of best quality in SJSU, very organized and clear.  No extra credit, but he is lenient with final curve and assignment deadlines. As a senior manager in industry, his lecture is very practical. 5 HW, 1 Project, 1 Final. Dont under estimate the workload, final project are time consuming, Have to learn by yourself.  The project is super hard and you will never get a hint how his lecture is connected to the projects.  I have been taking notes and listen carefully,  but still do not even know how I should start my homework and project.   Also strong accent, really hard to follow., I took it awhile back and feel like I can clearly rate him. He never talked about multithreading for iOS. As a learning CS student (not grad) I mistakenly done all my code on the main thread. This meant I save to SQL and other computational task on UI Thread. He never even discuss it. Clearly he does not give much effort into his class., His lectures were long. Good lecture slides. However, accent is SUPER hard to follow. I just dont find it fair to follow a hard subject when the professor is hard to follow because of his accent. Slides barely covered enough materials to do the projects. I find myself having to self-study. Last, his administration skill his very poor., Nice guy very knowledgeable and lenient with deadlines. 4 HWs, 1 final, 1 group project using all the concepts we learned in class. Thats it. HWs are simple and final he reviews a lot and gives many of the questions beforehand. Wants students to do well and is not trying to ruin lives. Accent can be a bit hard to understand., Uses high quality lecture slides and assignments to help you understand the material and prepare for exams. Exams were straightforward wminimal surprises. Lectures were boring. Did not seem very prepared during his lectures bc he tends to not explain most concepts thoroughly and reads off the slides. Expect to mostly self-learn."
Layla Pezeshkmehr,/professor/1698263,1.9,N/A,3.5,"Projects are completely separate from lecture and test material, but are more applicable to software development. Lectures are straight from slides, and the book has some errors that make the assignments confusing (same as her instructions for HW, tests, and quizzes). Have to learn some things really well to do well on tests., Professor Pez is super unclear! She forgot to put half the directions on the test, and class average score was F. She try to be nice, but very hard grader. Your answer is either wrong or right - no partial credit. Lecture is very boring - she just read slides. Lots of homework and group projects. Projects are unhelpful. Not a good networking class., If you truly want to learn sth. about networking, don\t take her class. Her lecturing style is dull: She just reads from slides when lecturing. She hardly answers student questions. The material is next to useless-far from applicable-for anyone wanting to do net. prog. or net. setup/maint. Though I got a good grade, I regret taking her class..., Despite knowing most of the content for this class she is regularly unprepared for class. Her lectures slides are from another source and is almost word for word in the book. Youre best off reading the book than attending class. Projects are straightforward but expect little to no input from the professor. Feedback on returned HW is lacking too, Easy course with projects that can be useful if you try.  Best approach is to read the text then go to class only if youve questions.  Fairly difficult exams, but its manageable., Last day of class and nobody has any idea what their standing is in the class. She doesnt explain anything in class... goes through prefabricated slides very sluggishly and without any of her own insight. The first review is right -- I dont think she is qualified to teach this class. Dont bother with class... Just stay home and read the book., shes not so bad and tries. i think she knows the subject., she wont help you with hw or in-class questions. i dont know if shes qualified to teach."
Tejaswini Karra,/professor/2575872,2.1,25%,3.5,"I really enjoyed Professor Karras class. We learned so many concepts within the software development lifecycle and tools that we would use as a Software Engineer. This class is heavily team dependent but as long as your team puts in effort, youll be able to create a great application for your resume!, Honestly learned a ton in this class. The coursework isnt heavy & depends on one large group projects your happiness will depend on the quality of your team. Shes a decent lecturer but I really liked how she focused on tools & concepts used in industry today., shesNice but sorry she doesn\t know how to teach, she seems like she doesn\t know what she\s doing, lacks so much confidence, says um kinda sorry all the time, she\s very hesitant when explaining things so nothing sounds credible. I know this is harsh but it\s true, I could understand better and save time if I just read the slides by myself., If you want to completely self study OOD, this is for you! As others have said, she\s too busy with her other job to even remotely care about teaching. She once said, This is a foundational class for CS. If you\re struggling with the material in this class, you\ll find that everything in CS & Engineering will be difficult. So encouraging!, She is literally so bad. Doesnt know how to teach. A lot of the students has a different background with OOP, she expects us to know everything. She uses Dr. Kims lecture notes. Doesnt explain clearly no in-class examples or any sort which helps us understand the material. Exams are also difficult, questions which she didnt teach comes up., Pros: Cons: - Too busy with her other job to teach us, tells us to go read the book on our own time - Condescending tone if you ask question she thinks is basic - Not good at explaining abstract concepts - *Sigh*, Shes a nice enough person but my god, she cant teach at all. She always lets us out 30-40 minutes early because she apparently cant be bothered to teach and her class is an utter mess. No one has any idea what is going on or what topic is being covered or what she wants us to do, we just sit there confused. What a waste of my time and money, What a terrible class. She gives ZERO examples and just monotonously reads the notes off the board (that arent even hers!). Gave out such a difficult exam and project in the first month of class when we barely learned anything. She doesnt know how to teach or how learning works, do yourself a favor and please dont take her."
Sanjoy Paul,/professor/2659813,3.0,50%,2.8,"One of the most caring professors iIhave ever met. The materials are hard, but he tried his best to make them simple to understand. The exams and quizzes are often long and would have to rush to complete, but they are all open book. As long as you understand the material and complete the HW you should do fine in the class., We had weekly quiz, two midterms, bi-weekly mini-project submissions and a final exam throughout. An extremely caring and respectful professor who tried to break down and teach complex concepts to its very basics, with clear lecture notes and an amazing teaching style!, Dense lectures. Quizzes every week. Homework is completely irrelevant towards exams, so you will have no extensive preparation for the exams except for reviewing lecture slides., Professor Paul is a decent professor; material is theory-heavy and can be difficult to follow. Review lecture recordings in your free time, otherwise youll be lost. Lectures cover way too much material. Quizzes are tough but if you pay attention in class youll be fine. Exams are difficult and homework is easy. Homework doesnt prepare for exams., absolutely terrible professor. reads off the slides, fails to explain many concepts, test format is horrendous (Canvas exam where you must keep scrolling back and forth to see an image and must type your answers -- including drawing graphs), Theoretically heavy and dry class, no coding. Respectful old style teacher. Very caring to his students, helpful in and out of class. Extremely experienced, passionate, and professional in networks and related fields. But expects a lot from students, super long exams and quizzes in limited time. Cant finish them without working in a group."
Jorjetta Jetcheva,/professor/2676520,4.8,100%,3.8,"Hands down one of the best professors in the department. Very knowledgeable and caring of students. Gave great lectures which were recorded. No textbook use and assignments were based on google colab notebooks. Grade based on 4 assessments with multiple re-dos allowed. Just make sure to make use of each attempt. No final if you pass each assesment, Amazing teacher! Have taken another course under her after completing 255. Just have to be sincere and you will get an A/A-. She allows you to explore the subject without making you worried about grades which is great. Responds to emails within a day. Encourages class participation., Very useful concepts but the lectures were too abstract. The areas of artificial intelligence and data engineering could have been explored a bit deeper. She introduced us to RASA, a conversational AI platform, and Neo4j Knowledge graphs - very practical and trending stuffs to learn (power to your resume). Overall, a good class., She is one of the best professors that I came across at SJSU. Gentle and introduce a lot of concepts in data mining and make you learn. Very useful homework. Lecture heavy but overall good learning. Very prompt to student queries., Prof Jorjeta is extremely underrated. She teaches every concept right from the basics and has a deep understanding of the subject. She gives out weekly assignments where she strongly recommends collaborating with others although it has to be submitted individually. Exams syllabus is from her slides. You will learn as much as you put in the effort., Absolutely amazing !!! So heres how to go about her course... 1. Tells you a lot of new concepts, algorithms, and lets you explore extreme corners of each of the topics. Best to know all the concepts/algorithms beforehand so that you can actually go and understand each and every corner case. Recommend watching YouTube for concepts before class."
Jim Mildrew,/professor/1900137,4.9,N/A,2.2,"I like this guy, Best professor learned a lot, I wish he would teach upper div cs classes, Prof. Mildrew Is one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. His lectures are clear and so is the criteria for grading. He is especially knowledgeable about C programming and cares a lot about the success of his students in his class. Make sure to show up to class and study the power points for tests and quizzes. Great teacher and nice guy too!, Great Teacher who is very willing to take time and speak with his students about the class and/or other academic subjects. Great teacher all around, though he did skim over one subject a little too quickly causing confusion on the midterm. Aside from that, a very solid teacher and would love to take another course from him again., Great professor! He understands the material and takes the time to explain it in his powerpoint presentations. His assignments are not too difficult and his quizzes are pretty easy. Take this professor if you want to learn C and not stress out while doing so. I would definitely have him as a professor again."
Michael  Finder,/professor/2024953,4.9,100%,1.5,"Not just another CS professor teaching game development, but an actual game developer teaching game development. You can tell hes passionate about teaching and the subject through his lectures. Explains material through on the spot examples, making concepts concrete. Will know most/all video game titles you throw at him., Amazing teacher, one of the few that actually cares about the class he teaches. It was inspiration learning from a teacher thats so passionate about game development. A real nice guy and very helpful. I put more time into this class and the project (I made an endless runner) than any other class Ive taken at SJSU because I loved it so much., Great class! The professor is really engaging, and really loves the teaching about games., Hes one of those teachers you just know they are passionate about what they teach. He is smart and can answer pretty any question related to games. This class is not hard but it does require effort because creating a game engine is a bit different than what is usually taught here at SJSU."
Leonard Wesley,/professor/2192627,2.7,34%,3,"Attendance is mandatory for In class assignments. Exams and quizzes are open book. Very bad teacher. You will have to teach yourself most of the things. Assignments are extremely vague. No one in the class can figure out what kind of answers he wants. This was an introductory bioinformatics class, will definitely not recommend him for any class., Do Not Take. Incredibly disorganized: he canceled 60% of the assignments in the syllabus and published no notification of this to students. He excused this by saying he was busy doing research for his second Phd. If he is the only one with open sections, just wait and take it with someone else. 350 chars is not enough to describe how bad he is., Amazing professor! Dont miss any courses that he offers"
Zeyu Gao,/professor/2386906,1.7,0%,3.7,"His lecture is the slides and his answers to questions are not clear. Every single assignment including the group projects is graded by TA even the group projects and midterms are graded by computer since MCQ. Not sure why he is even in class since he even let TA do demos and dip early himself. Even for HW questions, he tells students to ask TA., Hes knowledgeable but doesnt know how to teach. Hes really unclear about what he wants for the project, he gives teams an A for doing 22 test cases but gives your team a C for doing 40, in essence, hes never happy. Tests are hard. Homeworks are difficult and take forever. Ask him questions, but youll never get a concrete answer. Avoid him pls., Projects are good but documentation heavy Lectures are not good and outdated Other class is good but your grades will not suffer with professor Gao. Draw diagrams to impress"
Tazmina Sharmin,/professor/2832179,1.0,0%,4,"dont walk...RUNNNNN from this professor..\nShe is very disorganized to say the least. Her lecture slides are confusing and seems like she doesnt understand the material she is teaching very well..The midterm was EXTREMELY LONG and she did not take students feedback into consideration.\nDo yourself a favor and take someone else if you can., DONT TAKE. Unprepared: unfamiliar w/ online tools, got confused by her own lecture slides & gave shallow answers to questions. Jumps around the syllabus & tries to assign HW due 15 mins after class. Made up the project as she assigned it w/ vague specifications & kept adding more requirements before it was due. Brushed off criticisms with excuses."

Gerald  Benoit,/professor/3020820,2.0,0%,3,"The instructor presented real-world scenarios and encouraged creative thinking. However, the course lacked direct instruction, relying on students to self-teach from videos and readings. The Canvas platform was also disorganized. He did not update grades when Canvas quizzes marked correct answers wrong, even though screenshots were given."
Maryam Khazaei Pool,/professor/3065699,5.0,100%,4,"This professor has interactive lectures that combine teaching a concept and applying what you learned in groups. She is very caring and will help anyone who asks for help or clarification. This course is generally difficult, but she provides you with every resource you will need to do well in her class.

David Taylor,/professor/214947,2.7,31%,4.5,"just listen to the rest of the reviews on here.., Avoid at all costs, only grades in his class are the midterms and final. Programming assignments are helpful but if you dont get a perfect score, itll hurt your grade. If you dont get at least a C on the final, you fail his class., Very difficult and horrible professor. Avoid taking him to save your GPA. Strongly recommend taking CS 49J instead of suffering through CS 48 with him., Hes the hardest cs professor in the school for a reason. Not impossible to do well in the class, but youll be dedicating lots of time studying for the class. Your grade is solely determined by the maximum grade of your final and the two midterms combined. Dont take this professor if you have other difficult classes., By far the worst professor I ever had. His class is incredibly hard and most students fail. Even as a last resort, do NOT take him since he does not prepare you for his own exams. If you are in his class, drop if you can and save your GPA., If youre looking to get a grade higher than a C in this class, look for another professor. Think twice before taking Taylor., He is an unforgiving grader who gives complicated lectures and does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept. Unless you are extremely good at CS, I would highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Honestly if you want to really understand data structures and algorithms this class serves. Although it is a difficult class, the material is not bad and the assignments really help you grasp the concepts. If you go to his office hours he is always willing to help, you just need to make use of the resources., Do yourself a favor and pick another professor. Very harsh grader and bad professor, period., This guy made me hate my life for 4 months. 4 MONTHS. He gave me an academic strike for using an online solution to one of his assignments even though like half of the class did the same thing as me. Nobody knew how to solve it. That shows how bad of a professor and guy he is. Strongly recommend taking CS 49J instead of having to suffer with him., NEVER take a class with this guy. He always speaks to students in an intimidating and condescending tone of voice, even when they say hello to him in the halls. He should not be teaching anymore because when it comes to grading, he treats his students like theyre his worst enemies., The worst professor I have ever taken! He made my life miserable for 4 weeks! 4 WEEKS!!! I felt like my life was over. I am taking Vidya right now and her class is much better. I hope this guy gets karma for what hes done to me and so many other students (not horrible but like at least where he understands his mistake)., The only things that are ever actually graded are two midterms and one final; all three of which are hard. I highly recommend avoiding this professor., His teaching style did not work for me and many others since ~90% of students do not do well in his class. He expects people to ask questions they do not understand and lectures from there. No graded exams/assignments until the LAST WEEK of the semester. His philosophy is that you won\t worry about your grade and instead focus on the material, Do NOT take this professor. He is incredibly rude, intimidating, and condescending towards his students. Also, a good amount failed his class due to his impossible tests, yet he does not realize that hes the problem despite so many failures. This class was a waste of time and effort., Avoid at all costs! Your grade is only based on the final, which is extremely hard. Hes the issue, not the study habits., Do NOT take this guy. Ever. He makes students cry when they do not understand something and takes sheer delight in making their lives miserable for 16 weeks., I legitimately HATED this professor. He seems like an evil guy who actively likes seeing other people struggling and hurt. He rambled about how to be a good coder while providing nothing of value, assigned extremely hard coding problems, and never told us how to do them even though we were literally just learning Java., Harsh grader, makes students feel dumb by speaking to them in an intimidating and condescending manner, and your whole grade is only based on the final. Good luck., Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 146 professor available when I signed up for classes. I regret not waiting because his class was hell since he made me and my classmates cry by making us feel dumb when he did code reviews with us as he was very condescending and intimidating., Do NOT take a class with this professor. He is the toughest grader ever and is not that great of a teacher. Your grade is only based on the final exam., Terrible instructor. He does not even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how SJSU would hire someone this bad to teach. His exams are over-the-top hard as he thinks this is the only class students are taking. He also talks to students in an extremely condescending and intimidating manner. Please do students a favor and fire him., I cry every day being in this class with this professor. The fact that most students do not pass his class shows how bad he is., If I could give negative starts I would! This professor is legit the worst. He grades with no leniency, and even if you try, he will still criticize you and make you feel dumb. I was miserable every day being in this class with him. Do not take any of his classes. If you do, drop immediately. Do yourself this favor by not suffer through his classes, Dr. Taylors teaching style just did not click for me. He posted YouTube videos that we had to watch before class so he could ramble during lecture time about whatever. Your grade is only based on the final exam, so watch out. I highly recommend that you do not take him if you have options., Worst workshop instructor ever. I never took a workshop where the instructor was so unwilling to help students. I strongly recommend that you avoid taking any of his classes., The most difficult professor I have ever taken. Usually even with bad reviews I manage to get no lower than a B. This class isnt like that. Its very challenging and the only way that you can even get a passing grade is if you spend hours and hours preparing. Any other professor is a better choice dont make this mistake., He is THE WORST workshop instructor ever. He just rambles all lecture and does not give us hints, resulting in the class period ending before he can give them hints. The difficulty of the course is also very inconsistent. Go to the CSSL or get a private tutor for a lighter load., If you take his class, you will know exactly the definition of a nightmare. He does not teach anything but keeps talking about whatever it is. He grades so harshly, and your final grade is based on the final exam. Believe it or not, the majority of the class fails his class. If you want to challenge yourself, take his class., Do not take this guy, hes a really bad teacher as he is merciless when it comes to grading. He also speaks to students in a very rude, intimidating, and condescending manner. If I could do it again, I would have taken a different professor., Extremely difficult and unfair professor. His rote exams and final exam are very hard and he failed a good amount of the class. He simply does not prepare you to pass his exams, is extremely unfair, and you will regret ever taking him. Stay away at all costs., Do not take him EVER. Even if hes the only one open for that semester. It will really hurt your GPA if you even pass. Your grade is only based on the final and he just talks about whatever during lecture time. He needs to grade better or get fired., The people giving him good reviews are just glazers. Like where do you see him teach the class. He doesnt go over the topics needed for the class and just rambles on in lectures. Tests are challenges as well as the programs and he expects you to know the material form the class automatically., Taylor is a relic that needs to be uprooted from his tenure status. Your whole grade is based on the final, which is HARD. Also, he is very intimidating and condescending when talking to students. Think twice before taking Taylor. He may be a nice guy but avoid taking CS 146 with him since he does not prepare you for his own exams and assignments., I was NOT impressed with his class. He says that CS 146 was hard before he got to SJSU, but the truth is, he makes the class way harder than it needs to be. Also, his tone of voice is so intimidating., For the people giving him good reviews let me explain. His teaching his fine but his grading system sucks. U dont even know your grade throughout the entire semester which means in the last 2 weeks your gonna be stressing out a lot. You have 2 rote tests back to back and a final right after. Theres barely any room for a mental break., Taylors reputation on this site has tanked a lot recently for no reason. Hes one of the only professors in the CS department who chooses to teach rigorous material AND treats us like we can handle it instead of pampering us. For people who want to actually learn/are into math, hes one of the only options you have to learn this subject., Take any other professor. Even though they have bad reviews at least its easy to pass those classes. If you are taking upper division CS class for the first time I recommend not taking him. He will drain your grade and most people that took his class fail., Its pretty bad. Theres a reason why most upperclassmen recommend you avoid him unless you have a particular talent for coming up with algorithms., Does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept and skips multiple steps when teaching. Very condescending. Loves going off topic and rambling about whatever., I couldnt think straight for 3 weeks as I had a chance to fail. He knows his CS stuff but a horrible professor. He doesnt even teach the class right and expects people to know the material from his videos. The only grading is the test and he even takes of parts of ur grade for code if you dont get certain amount of points. Worst grading system!!, Worst professor in the whole CS department. He may be knowledgeable, but he grades so harshly and is not that good of a teacher. Do NOT take him even if you delay your graduation., The teacher does not care about his students. He has decided that he is not going to explain concepts and just talk about whatever during the whole lecture period, yet he grades like someone is trying to get their Masters in CS. Unless you love CS and/or want to have a miserable semester, I highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Theres a reason why all the other CS 146 professors classes are full for the upcoming semester. He is the worst professor I have ever had because he grades so harshly and talks in a very intimidating tone of voice with students. So, it would be best for students to wait until Spring 2025 to take the class when they have options., My 1-unit class with him felt like at least a 3-unit class. Individual teachers have lots of freedom with how they teach. They have certain things they are required to cover, but how they cover them and what extra content they add to the course is up to them. This is why his class was hell. Additionally, his tone of voice was so intimidating., If you cannot afford to wait another semester to graduate, take this class. If not, then look for another professor., He is THE worst professor I ever had. Avoid him like the plague, especially if you need to take upper level STEM courses or have other classes., Only take his class if you have A LOT of self-drive. You will self learn this whole course (with some assistance from his videos). Lectures were only worth attending if you had questions from videos. Has all tests in last two weeks. Code reviews give good feedback, not sure why people say hes mean. Also has a weird cult like student following., I like Taylors in-class lectures; they are entertaining and informative, like when he talks about his experiences. However, this class is extremely difficult, especially in the last week, where I was brought to tears. Others have already brought up how hard this class is, and they do not exaggerate. He can be condescending during office hours too., His grading style is just the worst. I strongly recommend taking another professor for CS 146 to avoid a nightmarish semester., The course and exams are easier than people say it is. Unconventional course structure, requires a lot of self awareness and discipline. However as long as you understand the material, the curve guarantees an A. Got a D+ on the rote exam and an A on the final. He has a very specific way of structuring questions, difficulty is definitely overstated., If possible, take easier prof + watch Taylor\s vids to learn more.\nOptional lectures unless you have questions. Low workload until 2 exams in last 3 weeks. 4 simple programs. Do HW weekly, review all vids a week before the rote + make practice Qs. Final is harder, definitely secure B- on the rote (which he shows the exact questions for)., Your entire grade is based off the midterm and final. His exams are very difficult and his YouTube lectures are hard to understand for a student new to this content. You actually do learn a lot but its because you know you will fail if you do the bare minimum. You have to decide for yourself if this amount of stress is worth it.. for me, it isnt., Worst professor ever! Honestly doesnt even care and makes his class so hard. He grades based on 2 things and they were both so hard. Made me really depressed pls dont take him. Looked at the classes available and hes the only one available wonder why. And what is with these reviews who cares how he teaches, its ur grade that matters., Prof. Taylor is the only 146 prof. who sits down with each student for code reviews. This is very helpful if youre ready, and terrifying if you arent. Yes, he grades on very few tests, but do all the optional HWs and youll do ok.\n\nYou probably wont get a great grade, and youll really have to grind, but youll be a better coder for it. Trust., Honestly the worst prof ever. Theres no way anyone can be this bad. Looking at the other professors I wish I had taken them instead. While I agree I learned a lot in this class his grade was based of the rote test and the final which were so hard. Never thought about actually failing a class till now. Please dont take him avoid even if ur smart., AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Not for the faint of heart. Save yourself some pain, suffering, and time by finding a different professor to learn DSA. Learning the material is challenging but not too bad. His grading system is horrible. DSA is a challenging class, but he unnecessarily complicates it. Would be better off taking a different professor., He is terrible. He literally claimed that our one unit class would be a cake walk and gave us a midterm that not one person could get credit on. Also, most of the things he teaches is unnecessary. Not only that, but all he knows how to do is talk as he makes videos that actually hold lecture content so he can ramble all class about whatever., He is one of the worst professors I have ever taken. If you take him, just know that your entire grade is based of off the final. He also makes a six figure salary, he really can care less about the students., He may be a nice guy, but as a professor hes terrible. He goes WAY too fast and talks WAY too much. His teaching method and grading style do not even make sense becuase your grade only relies on your final, which is SUPER hard. An understanding of covered material is simply not enough to get a decent grade., It is interesting that he likes or enjoys students suffering. If he wants to be a better professor, please listen to students. Stop covering up and do your job. Do you know how many student graduations/lives you have ruined? Students have depression because of him., Very tough on students. Lectures consisted of Youtube videos and class was all on advanced things. If you get lost you would have to work super hard to catch up. Code assignments took me an absurd amount of time and he has very high expectations of everyone., This is the worst professor at SJSU hands down. I have never been in a class before where I walked out more confused. He is a terrible professor because he talks too much and does not provide novice programmers any insight on how to code. I am so sorry if you are stuck to take him., The toughest and most intimidating professor Ive ever had. Do NOT take his classes. His material is good but he makes his exams SUPER hard. Homeworks do not help much for exams. CS 146 is already a hard course but he makes it way harder than it needs to be., David Taylor is a hard professor. He was called the gatekeeper/weeder because he failed half his class. I highly recommend you take someone else for CS 146., He is an unforgiving grader who gives complicated lectures and does not care if students pass the class or not. His teaching method and grading style do not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept. Unless you are extremely good at coding, I would highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Your grade is only based on the final and he is super rude and intimidating. He should not be teaching anymore., The worst and toughest professor Ive ever had. He is so intimidating and condescending. I still have nightmares from being in his class and my parents had to take me to a psychologist to help me deal with my night terrors., One of the worst professors Ive ever had. He was so tough and talked WAY too much during the 50-minute class period and he typically ran out of time to give students hints for the weeks assignment before the class ended. The difficulty of the course was also very inconsistent., Usually I take RMP reviews lightly because most people will only speak on their bad experiences but TRUST ME WHEN I SAY HE IS GENUINELY A TERRIBLE PROFESSOR. Talks too much and does not provide any insight on how to code. Extremely hard professor for NO REASON. Avoid at all costs., Professor Taylor was not equipped to teach CS48. We only had 50 minutes for lectures a week and he was terrible at time management, often rambling and running out of time to give you hints for the next assignment before the class ended. The difficulty of the course was also very inconsistent. Take CS49J instead for an easier class, Extremely difficult professor. Doesnt teach in class so you have to rely on his somewhat confusing youtube videos. Coding assignments are difficult with unhelpful feedback. Rote exams are challenging and final is so hard that some students didnt even try to study for it. Take someone else unless you want to take a risk., Hes a nice guy, but his exams are extremely difficult. He curves very hard so you will most likely pass if you put time into studying, even if you get a really bad score on the exam (my 43% became a B). Make sure to spend time on the programming assignments as well, I slacked off during the semester and lost some points on those., Very easy class to pass if you put in the effort. If youre trying to get an A, good luck because his final is extremely difficult albeit the curve is super generous. This is a DSA course, not a technical interview prep course. Be ready to learn about abstract topics that you will probably never touch again. Hes pretty funny too., His homework is challenging yet highly educational. Offers two preliminary exams with a maximum grade of B-, which can be superseded by a better final exam score, he wants everyone to pass his class. Provides personalized code reviews for each student, enhancing understanding. An excellent lecturer, though the material is inherently complex., Terrible professor, I am quite surprised that he still allowed to even teach a class at SJSU. He is the toughest grader ever, talks WAY too much, and does not prepare students for technical interviews., Taylor is a relic that needs to be uprooted from his tenure status. Your grade is only based on the final and he grades so harshly. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE AN OPTION, ANYONE ELSE!, Drop while you can. I had no choice than to take this professor and I thought that if I studied enough, I could make it through. Worst decision. He grades so harshly, talks WAY too much, and does not provide insight on how to code., How is this guy still employed at SJSU? I hope they get someone else to teach 146 since this guy is a joke and his tests are not reflective of the material taught in class. He grades so harshly that students do not have a chance of passing., You are given the exact format for two rote exams, which are capped at a B- on a curve, and one final which is also curved but uncapped and you do not have the format. He is a good teacher and as long as you do what he recommends you do at the beginning of the class you will pass easily. Try to get in as many code reviews as possible., He talks WAY too much and does not provide much insight on how to code despite the fact that the students have little to no coding experience., You will actually learn the content of the class if you take Taylor. The homework takes pretty long, consisting of optional videos and quizzes, but if you take your time to do them, youll do great in the class. Hes very helpful, will answer anything, and is always available. Your grade only consists of your final, which is something to consider., Flipped classroom style takes some getting used to but it is really helpful for traversing the content at your own pace. HW is difficult but allows you to really get an idea of how well you grasp the content. He is passionate about teaching and explains things in a lot of depth (sometimes too much :P), Its HARD. Homework is ungraded (def. still do it for practice) but grades are determined entirely by 2 exams (and you lose part of your grade if you dont finish programs you code throughout the semester). Curve was fair to me. Flipped classroom style, HW lectures are on YouTube and are generally solid. In-class lectures are interesting. Good guy., He talks too much and does not provide a lot of insight on how to code, even though many of the students have little to no coding experience., He might be passionate about the subject, but he talks waaaaay too much. Sometimes takes too long to get to the point. His teaching style is average, doesnt get straight to the point. Need to spend a lot of time on watching his lecture videos., I learned more from this class than any of my previous ones. There are a few major programming assignments, and he goes through multiple rounds of code review and feedback to help you solve the problem and improve your code. It was a tough class, but he really cares about making sure you understand the material., I took him a couple semesters ago and overall, the experience wasnt bad. If he ends up teaching CS 154 again, just know that you will only be graded with 5 tests, 3 of which are extremely difficult. The final does replace all your test scores, and the curve is extremely generous as well., Crazy difficult class, but I cant say I dont feel prepared for upper div CS classes., This class is flipped classroom style, but keep up with the video lectures. Class time is used looking at problems to build intuition for various concepts, so attending class is worth it. The programming projects give good learning experience. Overall, the class is hard, but theres fair grading, and its curved generously. Be ready to learn., David Taylor is a very respectable person. A very understanding human and will absolutely help students when asked. What you gain in this class depends on how much effort you put in, and dont worry about your grade too much, itll probably work out in the end. Ask questions about the videos and make sure you put in an effort on the homework., Ive had Taylor for CS 146. He is a little goofy, but is serious about the material. The subject it self was not too easy, but he give his own created Youtube videos to explain the concept visually. There are some program assignments, 2 rote exams, and 1 final. He give good practice exams for the rote exams. Very helpful., Work hard, memoize the sweat, and tears(yes, this class will make you weep), which then leads to an optimal grade. \n\nHe will also unlock coding secrets in your path to becoming a rockstar programmer!, Graded by only three tests, Professor Taylor is someone who will go the extra mile to make sure you understand a concept if you go and ask him about it, a lot of people are confused on specific topics and thats okay, but if you do not ask to elaborate then you will get nothing out of the course., Tough class and tougher grading, but you learn a ton. A lot of people give Taylor a disproportionate amount of hate because this is the first hard class they take in college., This guy is unneccessarily rough and does not prepare you for technical interviews. Its way too theoretical and not enough leetcode-type prep. Honestly, if youre thinking youll take him cause he\s the hard one, but he\ll prepare you for interviews, then you\ll just get an unnecessarily hard and theoretical class with none of the interview prep., Would find a different professor if I was you. Didnt really help me excel nor pass the class. Draconian style of grading not suitable for everyone, No textbook, just his provided notes. Join the discord and ask questions cus his class is difficult. 5 exams (50%) and 1 final (50%). If your final grade is better than class grade, it will become your new overall grade. Exams are very difficult so he curves. If you put in effort, you will probably pass but an A will be very hard., He is a unnecessarily tough professor. Does not prepare you for technical interviews. In that view Id definitely find a different professor if I was you. Hard to pass his class even with hard work., Dr. Taylor is an amazing professor. We will mostly learn algorithms through videos at home so that he can use class time for discussing interesting problems and answering students concerns. About the rote exams, they are easy. However, the final exam is extremely hard, so make sure you study the material after each class and avoid falling behind., Professor Taylor is very experienced in algorithms and if you want to learn the theory behind them, take him. But, there is not enough practice, and if you are preparing for interviews, prof. Taylors approach is not really helpful. There is too much in-depth analysis and some topics are only covered theoretically, with no coding exercises at all., Horrible. Best to avoid him. Luckily there are other options. Choose wisely, He really makes sure; exams are harder so you wouldnt pass the class. Exam-based class. Exams are super harder and you will never get basic or simple questions on the exams. Please take another professor. Sometimes, it feels like he loves to fail students, Taylor has a good mindset, and tries his best to teach. Hes sometimes confusing, but hell be happy to explain what he meant if you ask. Funny at times too, but tests are hard! Make sure to study his notes and more., Ok prof. put in the work, n ull get the feedback. tests r hard but manageable., Took him last semester, extremely tough professor with unclear grading schemes., first few weeks of class he complains about his past students and how dumb they were. Tells us the AVERAGE of test scores in the past was 30%. Has a specific answer key on Canvas; he puts in one or two answers and if they don\t match, full points off, e.g. extra space, tells us its because he\s too lazy to grade by hand and it\s not his fault., Taylors great teaching comes at the cost of a lot of hard work from the students end. This is by far the hardest class I have ever taken so far, and I sincerely recommend thinking twice before taking this professor. Also, dont cheat because he will catch you., He goes above and beyond. His videos provide a great visual intuition on how algorithms work. He assigned four coding problems, and gave individual code reviews for each, always providing very detailed feedback. Homework is hard but useful. It doesnt directly affect your grade. By far the best class Ive taken., Hard, theory-based class. Taylor really makes you work for your grade. Grade is 50% exams, 50% final. Final replaces the exam grade if you score higher on it than your exam average. No chances for extra credit, but Taylor generously curves. This is one of those classes where your goal is more to score better than others than anything else., Professor Taylor is a real gem. His 146 class is an opportunity for students to learn important skills for technical interviews and improve their coding / critical thinking capabilities. Attend his lectures, watch his videos multiple times to ensure you understand the content. Good luck and enjoy yourself, his class is the best youll take at SJSU., Grade is 50% exams, 50% final. Follows the teaching philosophy of failing half the class, then curving the median to a B., This guy won\t prepare you for interviews, because he\s gonna go over all of the theoretical parts of CS that aren\t needed for interviews. On top of that, you won\t learn to implement any of the algorithms that he teaches, you\ll just go over theory behind them. Finally, his YouTube channel, which has his lectures, are super unwatchable., a lot of people say hard but you learn a lot they are tricking you! you can learn a lot ant not torture yourself and thats what gets mistaken. the concepts in 146 are cool but are less cool when you are based on 100% grade weight on final., Passionate for subject. Can be mean when asked questions. He created a Discord for his class, but its better without professor since its easier to ask classmates questions. Confusing instructions on some homework and assignments. Canvas page difficult to navigate and grading criteria unclear. Hard enough learning online and he makes it worse, Entire grade based off of two final exams, one is a safety net (max grade B-) and the other is the actual exam. Both curved. Take a lot of notes from his videos. Dedicate your entire being to his videos and the algorithms. Dedicate. Everything., The worst professor. Does not know the material. Sometimes sets wrong answer key for the exam which is why my points get deducted on the canvas. Logically try to prove that my answer was wrong when my answer was absolutely right. Honestly he is not a good professor. He does not teach what he gives on the test., Baby boy... I get youre trying to make the class challenging.. but the classic giving easy problems on the homework/practice and ramping it up on exams to give the class a harder time? Its getting so old. Its tired. Showing us examples of the type of problems on tests is not taboo. Please do better., Do your best and dont cheat on his programs. If you cheat, he will find out. 4 programs, you will do code review (office hour 5-10 mins per visits) for credit, else 0 credit. Prepare to learn a lot of algorithms, time complexity etc. 2 rote exam 1 final in the end. He give exam practices which is very similar to his actual exam, you just study. GL, Best c lass and best professor I have ever had. Course consists of very well-done video lectures, and engaging in-class problem solving. Projects were well-defined, and auto-testing makes feedback near-instant. Tests were difficult but fair. This is an excellent prep class for the real-world of SW engineering., Sure, this is a very challenging class, but that should be what is expected for algorithm design and analysis. Interesting algorithm problems are discussed in the class. Took both cs146 and cs155 with Prof. Taylor, found his classes to be the most rewarding among all the cs class I ever took. He curved generously in the end., The class is tough, but you\ll learn important algorithms things that you won\t get from any other course -- it\s the hard part of CS that you can\t really learn on your own. Exams are difficult and are the basis of your entire grade, but he has a very lenient grading scale (in our case we only needed 20% of total exam points to pass the class)., Taylor is definitely a very knowledgeable professor and you can learn a lot from him, but his teaching style is not for everyone. He explains the main concepts but you have to research and learn from other "
Suneuy Kim,/professor/90503,3.8,66%,3.6,"at the time of writing this review, i think this was her first semester back? but anyway, the lectures are very important and should be used as review. the programming assignments suck the life out of you so be prepared for that. the coding questions on her exams are not that bad but the multiple choice screws you over if you get it wrong, The homework is way too hard and her slides are not very helpful either. You have to figure out everything on your own because she isnt very willing to help with troubleshooting either., The course is useful and you can learn quite a lot from it. The only downside is that she doesnt respond to emails., Her tests are fairly ok if you just read the lecture notes. The coding questions are really easy but the multiple choice questions are sometimes ridiculous and you will lose a ton of points if you get them wrong., Good professor. Lots of assignments but helpful to solve them., The content you learn is helpful in your development of java. She has a bit of an accent so its a little hard to understand her sometimes but her lecture notes are sufficient to learn from. She also allows you to use her lecture notes when taking the exams. Her assignments are a bit time-consuming but helps with learning the content., Too much homework,Crazy Crouse, The hw assignments were big & time consuming, but didnt feel relevant to class content. Very lenient grader for hw, not for midterms. Great lecturer, worth it to come to class and ask questions. Group project depends on groupmates, if theyre bad and dont contribute, you wont get an overall good grade, but your individual grade will be ok., Homework assignments were decently challenging, but doable. Midterm and Final were actually straightforward if you go through the slides very thoroughly. Group project was graded very leniently. Overall, the class wasnt super difficult but you do have to work for it. As for the professor herself, shes very friendly and caring. Go to office hours., Exams are pretty tough, but it is open slides. Some homework is easy, and others take much longer. Graded generously. Team-based project is pretty easy. Every team got at least 93% on it this semester. Lectures are pretty thorough but dry though. She is really helpful when it comes to asking questions, office hours, and email., Lectures are very clear and easy to follow if you listen to her lectures and do assignments you will pass the class. Its a hard class but she grades very generously to compensate. She tells you what will be on the exams during the lecture. The only downside is that assignments are important and time-consuming but worth little for your grade., If youre good at programming you can skip her lectures. Her TAs are extremly lax with grading on both programming and midterms/final but the programming assignments are relatively large. You have access to the notes during the midterms/final which is really nice. There is a group project and you might have to solo it if you have bad teammates., Professor Kim was really understanding and caring especially during the pandemic. She spent a lot of time for each lecture making sure everyone understands the concepts. She really wants you to succeed in the class and truly tries her best, even removing a topic so we have sufficient time to grasp all concepts. Definitely recommend!, Shes a nice person but a strict professor. Midterms are not open notes and are based on powerpoints with 70+ slides each. Homeworks take FOREVER so start early. Homework is only 10% of your grade and the rest are exams and project so make sure to study hard for them. Like the other comment, just try your best. Good luck, Her online style of teaching wasnt the best but just do the homeworks and try your best on the exams and you should be okay, She definitely knows what shes teaching. Exams are kind of tough but doable if you paid attention in class and did the homework. If youre looking to get a good understanding of DBMS, take Kim. The students who left bad reviews were the slackers and did the bare minimum., It felt like Professor Kim didnt really care about her students and was just tone deaf to everything going on. Her exams were super tough (class averages are Ds), she doesnt let you use notes, and her lectures are extremely dull. Lowest midterm gets replaced with final exam score if its higher though., One of the single worst professors Ive ever had. The slides for each chapter are overloaded with information (60+ slides) and she tests you on 4 chapters at a time for the exams. Doesnt let you use a cheat sheet or anything , expects you to memorize everything, lectures are super boring and monotonous, and overall Id never take her again., Her lectures are really boring and I have a hard time paying attention. She goes really fast and her midterm questions are really specific if you dont have a great memory. I thought her hw assignments were long but not really difficult at all. Just dont procrastinate. I wouldnt take her again., Kim is perhaps the best choice for database class in SJSU. No fluff, gets right to business. Explains clearly and methodically. Comprehensive tests: no long hard problems but virtually all little details of the material taught are covered. Weekly online quizzes, 1 pencil-and-paper homework, midterm, final, group project. Highly recommend., I have never scoff at me until I took this class. I constantly felt patronized for participating in class. Be ready to be asked many rhetorical question, and do large homework assignments where you are given no feedback and are no aid to the tests., I think this is her first semester teaching Nosql, hence, things can be inaccurate and messy at times. The assignments have out-of-class topics that you need to do more research in order to do them. Her instructions to install mongodb, aws are also kind of out dated. But this is her first nosql, he does try her best to explain the concepts in class, The first few weeks move a bit slow, but then it picks up from there on out. Grading is very picky on exams; final will replace lowest exam grade (if higher). Lectures move pretty quickly - be sure to ask questions if you need to. Kim is available in office hours and, though I did not attend any, I can see this was a mistake. Read, do hw, ask qs., Kims a great lecturer and teacher, especially when it comes to explaining theoretical concepts. However, her exams are tricky and she grades a bit strictly at first. But, she does curve in the end. She also replaces the lowest midterm score with your final exam score if you score better, so dont worry too much about failing one midterm., Dr. Suneuy Kim is an inspiration. Shes incredibly caring about her students and genuinely wants you to succeed. Always approachable. Answers every question. Very clear lectures., You have to go to class and pay attention in order to well on her tests although attendance is not mandatory. One drawback i see is she is not really helpful through emails if you want to ask questions. However, she is helpful in her office hours. The group project is realistic and fun to do, If you attend lectures and take good notes, all youll have to do is skim the textbook. 4-5 coding assignments and a group project. Midterms/final are mostly handwritten coding problems, but she allows an 8x11 cheat sheet (no code allowed, though.) Gives study guides for midterms. No random quizzes. One of the best in the CS department., Kims CS157A is much easier compared to her CS151. Homework is all online with answers posted on many githubs. Group project takes a large chunk of your grade but was graded easily. Just dont wait until the last minute. Midterms and Finals are mostly based on her lecture slides and should not be too difficulty if you understand the slides., Kim is hands down one of the best in the CS department! Professional, caring, and knowledgable. Her lectures are packed with info so attending class is important. The pacing of her lectures can be inconsistent- Be sure to pay attention or youll easily miss something. Easy midterm, difficult final, and group (of 3) project that could be solod :), Took her summer session course. It was intense because of the short 10-week time span. Programming assignments are very time consuming, but you learn a lot from them. Exams are tough, and she deducts quite a bit for minor mistakes (triple-check your answers). Groups are assigned for project. Curves class grade if necessary, but doesnt announce it., One of the best professors Ive ever had! She cares so much about her students and encourages everyone to ask questions frequently. Her hw assignments were very time consuming and tedious but really reinforces the material taught in class. Tests arent hard as long as you study and come to class. One group project at the end of the semester., A lot of the concepts have been discussed in CS46A&B as well as CmpE 131. I wish she would have focused more on GUI and interesting programming techniques, but given she uses a book from Horstman you can\t expect much. Mispronounces technical terms and bangs on the white board. You will hear her say Focus a lot, homework is ample, so start early., Kim has a sweet and endearing personality that helps carry you through the material. Lectures are organized well but take notes because the slides alone are not enough without her added commentary and notes. Tests are challenging but fair - make sure you study the slides and examples from lectures. 2 tests, semi weekly hw, 1 group project., I enjoyed Dr. Kims assignments and lectures. Her hw assignments are not difficult, they are just tedious but they apply well on what were learning in class. Her exams are not too bad, theyre based on lecture notes and you get to have a cheatsheet which is convenient. Loved the group projects. I learned so much in this class. Thanks Dr. Kim 3, The best lecturer and professor at SJSU! This is the only class I really learned in Spring 2016. She respects her students and treats her students equally no matter what level you are. She makes me feel so good after the exam although her exam is super long and hard. She tried her best to help you especially at the end of the semester., Very very good lectures. Class is extremely fast paced so dont even consider skipping class. Assignments are extremely time consuming so make sure you start as early as you can. Exams are also extremely challenging. You really have to work for your grade. She is at the same time a very motherly and kind person so use her office hours!, She is such an amazing lecturer! Her lecture notes are very clear. She introduces knowledge clearly and gives very good examples.  Coding assignments perfectly reflect the content and also is helpful for exams too. I am an EE bachelor to pursue CS master and taking her class as prerequisite. I am very glad to take this course, it worth the time!, She is such an amazing lecturer! She can go pretty fast at times, but if you pay good attention in class, take good notes, and study/understand her lecture notes, you will do just fine in her exams. Coding assignments are challenging but completely doable. I learned a lot in her class and I love her teaching style!, Kim is a great professor, lecturer and person. Shes very helpful, thorough and always willing to answer questions. Assignments provide almost no hand-holding and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment when you finally complete them - you will not want to put them off till the night before due date. Tests are also challenging but rewarding., Very fair and helpful. Very organized and no surprises. There is a group project in the end, in which you have about 6 weeks to do. She assigns the groups so no-one ends up alone. Highly recommeded., Definitely agreed that Kim is one of the betterbest CS professors on campus. Her lecture notes, grading, and assignment expectations are all crystal clear. Youll have to work hard to earn an A, but youll also learn quite a lot. If you get stumped, make sure to ask her questions: shes a nice person!  4 HWs, 2 midterms, 1 group project, One of the better teachers in the CS dep. Theres a lot of content and she goes through it thoroughly; open to questions at anytime and is very approachable.  Tests can be difficult. Asmts are reasonable and relevant. She gives you every opportunity to succeed if you work for it, if you fail you may need to rethink think this major.   1010 WTA, She doesnt care about students or respects them. She makes up a ton of ridiculous rules and doesnt lose a chance to deduct points. If you ever have to argue with her, good luck! Shes so full of herself that she just wont accept other people can ever be right. The material is easy and she tries to include a lot of useless info in lectures., Good teacher overall. She gave tests on Fridays for all sections at once (including the final). Language barrier is occasionally an issue, but usually shes pretty clear. Assignments generally arent too difficult, just make sure you give real time and effort to them. In tests you can bring some notes., I think Kim is one of the better CS professors on campus. She really cares about how youre doing in the course. If you pay attention in class and get help when needed, an A is quite manageable. Some questions from her exams are taken from the lectures and you can find an example of her midterms online. Exams are long so manage your time., Kim packs her lectures with information. Shes full of energy and passionate about teaching. I enjoyed her DBMS class and learned so much. I would definitely take her again for another class., I love her class., Excellent professor. Very clear, but midterms are rather hard. Study regularly and early, and you will probably do fine. Smacks whiteboard frequently for emphasis. May tell a cheesy joke one or two times during the semester for practice. Slightly unclear/inconsistent about late policy, which cost me an entire assignment once. Look out for that one., Outstanding lecturer.  Knowledgeable, organized, very well prepared, engaging.  Read the book, go to class, do the homeworks, study the notes - you will do very well and learn a great deal.  What more can you ask for from a prof?, All I can say about Professor Kim is excellent. There are many HW compare to others Professor but it is good to learn from that.Exam is challenge. I learn a lot from this class, thanks   pro Kim., Having Kim back from leave is great since she is a good teacher. Assignments were engaging as well as fun to write. However, I found her lectures to be a bit dry at times. Also, her midterms were a challenge given the time limit. She does let you use reference sheets on all tests but I feel she could structure them better. Nice lady overall, She explains well and covers all the material clearly, but she goes fast and covers a lot every lecture. You should read the book in advance so that you can follow and get the points she tries to make. Dont start the assignment late, you can get full scores on them with basic attention to requirements. Tests are challenging., Professor Kim is really calm and relaxed and is approachable for help. She will notice if you slack off in her class or if you dont show up often. Her tests are hard, but she covers everything in her lectures or homework. The homework is tedious, but she tells you exactly what to put and will regrade if necessary., She really knows Java. Her notes are amazingly helpful, sometimes its even better than the book! The assignments are easy if you study the books examples, and her tests are based on her notes. I learned a lot., I couldnt study any of my other classes because of the extreme homeworks., Shes a good teacher, but her tests are challenging. Dont expect to use a laptop during your tests because you dont. Its all pen and paper with her tests. However, with her homework assignments, she tells you EXACTLY what you should do. Just follow the instructions. Overall she does explain everything in detail. There are quizzes so go to class., The lab assignments are just waist of time because her lectures and labs are totally different. I think she should use the lab time for home work assignments., Avoid this teacher if you can. Her lectures are really hard to understand and her home work assignments take weeks to complete.If you need help,the line for her office is way too long, and by the time its your turn,time is over.Also,the midterms are way too hard, if you dont spent 24 hours on doing the homework and assignments, you will not pass, Professor is well prepared with her lectures and has a perfect time management. She reiterates important concepts/ideas and helps students while working on the assignments. Fair grading. Recommend this professor., If you do not have great programing experience, you will not pass her class. First of all she does not understand that cs 46B is just intro to database, she wants you learn how to write code from scratch (implementation).Secondly,even though if you understand the lectures, the home works are really hard and time consuming.Dont take her., Taking cs46B with Dr kim is just waist of time! Her lectures are really fast, and her home works are hard, and long.Most of her quizzes are based on the home works, so if you cant get the home work done, you basically done.Drop the class as soon as you can!You wont learn anything and you will end up with a D., Very helpful.Highly interested in teaching the course and making students understand the material.Homeworks and exams are easy if you understand the lectures., Avoid this teacher like the plague. Her lectures are really hard to understand and goes super fast. And when you ask a question, she just repeats the info that you didnt get. Its hard to understand what she asked on the homework and marks points down for silly things. If you can, choose a different teacher., One of the hardest computer science professor ever. All her home work and lab assignments are really abstract and does not match with the lectures., CS46B is definetly an intimidating class. I really didnt learn anything in 46a and was not prepared at all. I failed all the programs and midterms at first, but Dr. Kim really helped get back on my feet. She is really helpful and her office hours are a blessing. Just do all the assignments and you will be fine in the class. Curves at end of semeste, Extremely intelligent & helpful prof. in CS department! Her lectures are comprehensive. Advice: Dont miss the lecture. You can understand alot by reading lecture one time before go to class. Programming and exams are OK!. Final is comprehensive. If you study well on her notes and class lectures, you will be fine. Thanks, Prof.Kim, read her notes before coming to class, she will do what she can to help you, she will use every minute of her class time so dont expect to go early, midterms are hard, but if you realy pay attetion are duable. no one really gets good grades on the 1st midterm so dont stress, do all the programs and group project make sure u have a good group, good professor, tough midterms but they are doable, tries hard to give students complete understanding., A good teacher. English needs work, and it shows on the midterms. But if you do the homework and understand it, youll learn plenty. Midterms can be challenging, but actually fun., She is a good teacher. Lectures are very good. Class notes are good(mostly from the book). The book is questionable. HW/Assn are easy and dont prepare you for the exams. Exams are too long and redundant, yet skip some important topics that were covered in class. I *did* read the book and got even more out of the classes., A bit challenging.. Lots of homework and labs. Very difficult tests and quizes. But something about her makes you want to try to impress her and show her how smart you are. I like this lady., I took Dr. Kim for 2 semesters. She is super nice. She is glad to help you in every way she can. She doesnt curve. Her lecture is a lil bit confusing. Her assignments are kinda hard. Her midterms are harder. Her final is ok. I hate the textbook. Dont rely on the textbook too much. You can study everything from her., im not a big fan of programming. but she made it worse! she has a thick accent, and you can tell english is not her first language. in fact, the lectures sucked. homeworks are not related well to lectures. and she doesnt understand your questions. take the class only if you want to teach yoruself from the book., professor kim is a great instructor.  she is clear and she makes sure she emphasizes the important points so that it will stick in your mind.  It definitly will help in the future.in the beginning of class, you may be frustrated with her repeating things...but towards the end, youll thank her for it.take her for 46a/b, she give u strong foundation, She is not clear, teaches things that arent in the book, expects you to know things that arent in the book and havent been taught, uses topics chapters ahead of where we are, has very hard homework and exams, moves way too fast.  I dont think she realizes this is a BEGINNERS course!Only the people with programming experience can follow., This teacher sucks! She is not that good at explaining things. But more importantly, you know those teachers that you ask a question and they got NO idea what you talkin about, but lecture you anyway? and on top of that, her step by step directions for the labs are terrible! and you gotta fuigure out where they went wrong youself. do NOT take!, A very very helpful professor. She is very patient and will answer the same question till everyone in the class gets it. Wish you were teaching CS46B this semster Dr. Kim., Very nice professor. Very intelligent and provides the slides she uses for her lectures on her website. Therefore, it is a lot easier to study for her exams. However, her exams can be very difficult as they test major details from the concepts you learn. Her assignments shouldnt be difficult if you took CS 46A seriously., A teacher in whose class you WILL learn a lot, assuming you want to pass.  Not the best choice if you want a slackoff class (actually a very bad choice).  Lots of work, but if you do it all, Im sure youll probably get at least a B.  An A would require higher understanding though., excellent teacher. you will learn something if you take her class. explains very clearly. Thanks Dr.Kim, teacher who takes her job seriously. she stresses herself too much though, and it can be nervewracking when she bangs the board to convey a concept. way too much muddy details, sometimes following the direct format of the book, needs to narrow the topics down. tests are from dantes hell., Very nice teacher. Does a good job at explaining concepts but tends to not go into implementation in detail. Assignments are all implementation of concepts rather than use of them. Spent lots of time at office hours, helped GREATLY and was eager to do so. Tests are very difficult so know your implem, Gives very explicit details in her programming assignments, but doesnt give you the tools to accomplish it. Office hours prove benifical if you understand some of it. Hard to program when all she teaches is the concept and not the example code to help you implement the idea, clear but super difficult, This teacher is great! She is very descriptive and goes through here work in detail; however, her tests can be a pain because they have trick questions. If you really want to learn Java, take her but if youre looking for a class to get by then dont take, her lectures were well organized and helpful. If u could get pass her accent, u dont even really need to look at the book cuz her lectures teach u everything u need to know for her hw and tests., She presents slides and everything to help you, and is really clear once you get used to her accent, She was one of the best teacher I ever have in SJSU.  She was clear and organized.  She was not the kind of professor who just read the text back to you.  I learn so much in her class that I had a easier time in CS46B and highly recommend her!, i took with her CS46A and CS46B, she is hard, clear, but very helpful, I recomend, Organized, boring at times. tests are fairly hard. accent can be a small problem., Outstanding teacher, took her last semester.  Her exams are crazy, crazy hard but she curves to make it fair.  I would take her for every class that she teaches in CS.  Learned the most from her., sign up for her class, no problem., She tries to help you understand the material as much as she can, but half of the time, her words are so off sometimes, I have no idea what she says.  Quizzes, midterm, and final was CRAZY hard., Very clear instruction, but the quizzes, midterms, and final are insane.  Tests you on subtle, complex stuff.  The lab exercises are out of sync with the book/teaching, so its almost like taking two courses simultaneously.  10-15 hrs/week outside class., good teacher... but hard midterm, I do not suggest this teacher for an introductory course in Computer Science, you will feel the long term damage of her ineffective teaching methods in upper division., HARD MIDTERMS.. other then that teaches pretty good.., Wants you to learn. Helpful outside of class. Hard midterms, very nice person and helps u out; hard midterms though"
Marty Froomin,/professor/62007,3.2,0%,3.3,"Lost my respect from day one., Love ya, Marty!  Keep up the good work!, Hes my hero!  Keep on rating yourself Marty at the site that cannot be named!!!  :), You need the book for the class but expects you to know EXACTLY what he knows. Deviate from that and you will fail the class., Can you say BORING? What a waste of time. I could learn more from reading a book. This is way too easy. It is not college level caliber and neither is the instructor., All this guy does is repeat what is in the book. His testing is not related to what he goes over in class. I totally wasted my time. I cant wait until they replace him., Has no curriculum, doesnt use the textbook 99% of the time, lectures are 80% unclear, entire semester is based on lectures, hes narcissistic, egotistic, unapproachable, and sometimes assigns homework which he has little knowledge of.  Overall, he could use a class or two on how to be a better teacher., This is a guy who was picked on his whole life. Now he takes it out on his students. Sad controll freak. Worthless teacher., This guy is on an ego trip. He likes to act very athoritative, but may be compensating for his short stature, and balled head. You can learn just as much without him....if not more., worst teacher. do not take. EXTREMLY LAZY, Narcissist, anyone? All 50 good comments are written by himself-he admits it 1st day of class. Lectures consist of pointing to pages in book, then testing on random topics hes never addressed. Grades extremely hard. Not flexible. Made me glad for CSU budget cuts-professors like this do not belong in a classroom attempting to teach., thinks he is easy and helpful but he is not. hard grader. expects you to know what he knows., He works at Sun, so he tries to incorporate as much of Sun as he can in the syllabus. He wasted our time in the UNIX class, teaching us Solaris, instead of a simpler and universal version of Linux. He wants students to write exactly what [he] taught and to try not to use their brains (!?). Even if your response on the exam is better than what he, Hes the laziest professor I ever seen. Lot of lab nights. And the funny thing is he use the same quizzes and Midterms over and over for every semester. I got some pass paper from friend and got an easy A for the class. Not recommended if you wanna learn stuff., If you have seen good reviews on this teacher, that must be posted by himself. He doesn\t even feel shame on saying that he would comment himself on this website on our first class. If you just need a credit, but it won\t be good btw, take his class, because the sentence he said most often is tonight is the lab night, you are free to go., The worse CS professor that Ive had. Wasnt able to tell how many megabytes are in one gigabyte. His lectures are all about reading the textbook, he will ask you to memorize stupid commands. Be ready, he tries to make his midterms and finals really hard with questions that he didnt go over.DONT TAKE HIM. You will wast your time., Half of the classes are actually no lecture at all. The lectures are only I will test on you on page ...., I will not test on page .... On the final, there appears something from the pages that he said he wouldn\t test us. No notes, slides, or others at all. He sometimes can\t answer students\ questions. What he said wasdon\t waste your time, This guys a real loser. He teaches for ego boost only. Likes to be in command. Must have got picked on a lot when he was a boy. Actually still looks like a little boy., No Comments, Need to pay attention to lectures. Take advantage of lab time offered. Picky when it comes to grading. Practical final killed my grade. But, he warned me., Interesting to talk to and aproachable. Has a teach yourself philosophy and doesnt lecture much. Very big on following directions and will be heavily penalized for small mistakes. The class was ok until end, when it pretty much fell apart. The final ended up having irrelevant/unfair questions and was worth 40% of grade. I dropped 1/2 grade from it, Not a difficult class. Decide for yourself and go talk to him during his office hours., he is a freaking trainer. He forces you to remember everything (Its purely pointless to memorize the whole book in real world). And he will made jokes thats not even funny. I hate Splaris after I took his classes. Im writing just to make sure people wont be trapped in his classes. By the way, I passed his classes!, He thinks he knows more than he really does. A real phoney., No Comments, He is not that knowlagable., Everyone who is here basically just want to know if u should take him as your instructor...YES. So there., First half was easy. Second half was tougher. Practical was tough but very realistic. Unfortunately I didnt do as well as I thought. Grade really dropped in the second half., Bummer that this is going to be a smiley, because it shouldnt be.  Martys friendly to a fault--CS 172B should be a much harder class than it actually is.  Lots of rote memorization and not enough practical assignments.  Theres a practical final that is intended to put the fear of God into students--really, the whole class should be like that., What I learned to hel;ped me get a job. The grading is tough. Overall I was not disappointed., After taking CS072 and CS172A I thought he was an excellent teacher. However, after CS172B I was very disappointed. The guy didnt teach anything new and every other class there was no lecture but a lab time(meaning i have nothing else to tell you my dear students). Totally agree with the previous statement - review of past 2 semesters!, What a difference between 172A and 172B! Was very organized for 172A and didnt even know what to say in 172B! Invent lectures every class! Have you go over his vaforite VI again, over crontab AGAIN, /etc/passwd file AGAIN and many more other AGAINs! Very disappointing! Basically, CS172B was a review of CS172A!, First half of the semester is easy. Second half is harder. Ithought I knew the material until I took the Practical Final. He taought me everything I needed to do well but I blew it. I shoud have taken advantage of the lab time offered., His lectures can get a bit dry, but he gets to the point.  Its not a difficult class, exams are fair, just attend class and take notes and youll be fine.  Hes helpful outside of class and has a good personality. I would continue taking his classes., This guy does not teach! Every lecture, he keeps inventing new reasons why Unix is inferior to Windows in every way, and how Vista eXPerience will be the final nail into Unix\s coffin.  He even said that we can\t get more than a C if we are not running Windows Vista Beta on our laptops by the end of the semester.  AVOID!, Just want to thank him for the job I got. He mentioned some job opportunities in class. With his help I got an interview. What he taught me got me the job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you., He knows the material. He cares about the students. Sometimes he talks too fast, but he will repeat. Overall he is better than most., Grading is tough. You must know the material. His exams are fair and his grading is consistent across all students. He gives you the skills you need to get a job. There are a lot of whiners out there. If he sucks so bad why is he still teaching. Probably because no one else wants to teach the course., This guy is a joke, you will learn more by yourself than going to his boring classes. His grading is worst than obaid. Could not answer most questions from students and I would not had taken him if he wasnt the only guy teaching. Has no respect to many students. I also know he treats females better and Im lucky to be one. Got a B in both classes., knowledgable guy but is not lenient with grades. midterm and final make up majority of the grade. quizzes and hw are worth nothing in comparision. no partial credit. its either all right or all wrong. he is not shy when it comes to failing lots of people. guess hes on a mission to weed out the weak...take him if you are confident in the subject., This is not a class for fun - definitely not an easy A. You will learn in this class! Marty knows exactly what hes doing and knows his material and make sures you know what is the MOST important. Wish more time was covered on significance of files rather than memorizing which files are where. Cares for his students TREMENDOUSLY!, If you value your grades, avoid. If you value a real education, take him. He is one of the best teachers in the CS department. He cares for his students inside and out of the class. He has experience from Sun. He knows Unix inside and out as well how to teach it. HIGHLY RECONMENDED to anyone who wants to learn Unix., Very hard guy. Grades mostly based on midterm and final. Lots of people failed his class because of the final, so watch out if you take him. Be prepare for midterm and final. They are the most important. Quiz and hw are ok. Lecture not that interesting. Can make your mind wonder off to somewhere else., You will definitely learn a lot about Unix in that class.  Marty probably knows the subject better than anyone else in the CS department, and he knows how to teach it, too.  His teaching style alone makes the Unix Admin sequence worth taking. \n He also helped me fix my Windows laptop after a piece of spyware crashed it dead.  Thanks, Marty!, very good teacher, but grades are mostly based on finals and midterm. If you did bad on the midterm then your only way out is the final. All the hws and quiz dont help much but just to keep u hanging. STUDY ALL QUIZES FOR TEST AND FINALS., No Comments, Bottom line: Your grade in the class does not do justice to the amount you will learn in the end. 70% overall on the midterm and final, and material from courses previously in the unix series frequently show up on exams. Grades efficently (next class day)and is very helpful to students in and out of class regardless of most topics., Good instructor,knows the subject very well and very helpful if you ask questions directly or through email.He grades the papers fast and returns them the next class.Strict grader and no curve means you have to do well in all the quizzes and midterm.Has 30% for one midterm and 30% for final,so need to do well on both the tests to get good grade., a friendly instructor, but he grades extremely strict! ie. no partial credit. Some did well but i guess around half of the class are failing toward the end of the semester. btw, lectures are short, so the rest of the class time is for you to go over stuffs, ask questions or leave., He is a really good teacher. He real cares about the subject. It doesnt hurt that he is hot. :), The majority of this class is being able to do the work. It is not simple memorization. He expects you to know the material. Grades are based primarily on two exams. If you do well on the quizzes, then you should do well on the exams. The practical final is an eye opener. He tests what you can do., This is definitely a class where you have to learn by doing. He offers lab time for us to use and familiarize ourselves with the material. there is no open lab and there are students who choose to leave rather than use the time offered. Oh well, their loss., He may be tough, but I am prepared to get a job. The whiners are the ones that do nothing and expect to pass. If you are not capable, you wont pass his class. He expects you to know the material and tells you exactly what you need to know., His lecture is horrible. He does not teach. Good luck for someone who wants to take his class., Yeah yeah he is good but when it comes to midterm and final he is tuff why when someoneone puts enough, alot of hard work in this class it doesnt mean anything to him.. and people are saying he is good becuase they all pass .., Not the easiset teacher, but one of the most caring towards his students then any other ive seen. Midterm and Final are 70% of your grade, a few programming assignments and quizzes disperesed evenly. Easy to talk to, funny, outgoing, and well one of the best lecturers Ive ever had, Easy at first but then it gets harder. The beginning is easy because he prepares his students well in CS172A. The harder part is because it is new material. He really wants you to know the material and be prepared for a job. He definitely cares., He is a great teacher. Knows the material and makes sure you learn it. Wish there were more like him. He cares more that the full time professors., Froomin knows his subject and knows how to teach it.  Yes, his tests and quizes require lots of memorization, but it is almost crucial when it comes to UNIX.  I would definately recommend taking classes with him.  Hopefully he is around when I take 172b., Highly recommended teacher! Reasonable homeworks and exams as long as you study whats given in class. See him more as a friend level but is very respectable :) Lecture is fun and interesting. Take his class!!!, Bad instructor, midterms and quizes are very long and hard.... shouldnt take him, Acceptable teaching techniques, however the grading does require some well needed overhall.  Very help full through e-mails, as well as his office hours.  Needs to add more than one midterm to his class, because one midterm of 30% doesnt help., Marty is a badass sysadmin.  Take him if you want to know Solaris., A cool instructor who refuses to be called professor and who is very personable...he tests hard...and EMPHASIZES attention to detail...but you will know your UNIX when hes done with you...to say nothing about him bein a bad ass Harley motorcycle rider., Is the great teacher who gives exact or similar previous classesexams and quizes to students? (e.g. Exams and quizes of yrs 2002 and 2003 about 90% simililary).Just ask students who took his 172A for Fall 02 and Spring 03, you will see how close they, Great teacher, probably the best Ive ever had.  Makes the material very clear and focuses on things that are useful in the real world., One of the best teachers at SJSU, he was the reason why I ended up liking Unix so much, Learn real world/useful material. Straight-forward, clear lectures., I look forward to his class. I learn a lot. He makes the material easy to learn."
Chung-Wen Tsao,/professor/2318479,2.1,29%,3.6,"Great professor for this class. If you are truly interested in the subject, you will do great in his classes.  Attending class is extra credit, so you really cant fail this., Great professor.  Amazing with accessibility outside of office hours, writes tests which dont pull material from thin air.  Overall, wonderful class.  100% would suggest taking him.  He started a bit mumbly, like some of the comments said, but he really improved less than half way through the term., Prof. Tsao has been among the worst professors Ive had the pleasure of taking. He is kind, responds to emails quickly, and generously offers extra credit. However, his lectures are disorganized. He skims over key concepts and often makes mistakes in quizzes and midterms. You will learn more through self-studying., Strong chinese accent plus very slow slide reading leads to a very disengaged classroom. Use quizzes to study for midterms, same for finals., Lectures are really hard to understand. Nice person and will respond to you if you have questions. Exams are pretty straightforward but lectures are so boring and youll learn more by self studying. You get some notes on exams which is nice too and makes them fairly managable., The professor doesnt teach well, so be prepared to self-study. If you do, quizzes and homework are easy. There are two midterms, which can be a hassle. This semester, many did poorly on the first, so he held a bonus midterm with two questions from the first one. The final grade was the average of both midterms., Mumbles a lot, does not have clear grading criteria or schedule, goes over class time, would not take him for another class, Has an accent but is definitely understandable, one homework a week which isnt extremely difficult but not easy, labs on fridays which can be easy or hard, responds to emails very quickly, nice person in general and easy to talk to, helps and talks to students if they ask/email, only downside is that the lecture content is boring, Teaching was ok, lectures made me sleepy, participation quiz at end of class. Hes nice, has an accent so can be hard to understand. HW is through Zybook and 1-3 quizzes each week. Only issue were typos in quizzes and tests. All test are compilations of prev quizzes. Lab is chill, lab exams are fine if you have a firm understanding of the concepts., Weekly homework but 2 attempts and sometimes gives answers in class. Lectures are hard to pay attention to, but slides / homework let you self-learn. Midterms + Exams let you have 3 full cheat sheets and are very similar to homework / practice exam, so they were easy. Extra credit to participate. Responds to Canvas fast. Good if you can self-learn., He was going over one of our assignments and then got stuck.. then gave up and just told us to input it in our IDE to get the answer. He doesnt even know the answers to what hes teaching. SJSU do better and hire better professors., He is bad. A bad bad man ., Bad at teaching. His lectures are barely audible and boring. Most of what you learn will be covered in the textbook (ZyBooks), which will be your weekly HW. Theres also a quiz at the end of every class. His tests are manageable, but there are at least 3 or 4 typos in each one. Labs are difficult, but will actually teach you things, Youre better off skipping lectures and just watching YouTube tutorials and doing the homework. The lab instructors are very good in my experience., He is a horrible lecturer, hard to understand, and his lectures are hard to follow regardless. He requires you do homework through Zybooks which costs $100. His tests and quizzes are a mess, hard to understand and full of mistakes. The class isnt hard but that is in no way thanks to the professor., Mumbles quietly to himself while looking down at his laptop during long lectures. Formatting of answers on quizzes are wholly unclear. Slides are contextless amalgams of stuff just sort of happening without any explanation. Clearly has no idea what hes doing and was unable to find a real job. Shame on SJSU for hiring him., Only took him again out of necessity, not a good teacher. Use the class discord & learn from other places.\n\nPros: Responsive outside of class, the difficulty of midterms and final is fair(-ish), quizzes/HW are 2-attempt and show wrong answers.\nCons: Confusing questions/slides, answer key errors, and rough accent/poor English., Tons of zybook hw the first 2 weeks. Thick accent. In class quizzes every lecture, with chances to earn a small amount of bonus points. Midterms and final mostly multiple choice, you can memorize if you want to do well. Final recycles a lot of questions from midterms., He gives lots of HW and quizzes, about 60 of them total, and 2 big projects. Class is super time-consuming and the professor is terrible at lecturing. Gave out WRONG answers for practice midterm. Nice guy and reachable outside of class. But your classmates are better at teaching than professor., Hes chill and not like rude but its hard to understand what he says in class. Use resources. For midterms some of the questions are from in-class exercises so its best to memorize the answers. The first midterm was pretty hard and probably the hardest one. Also he doesnt round grades so if your stuck at a 89.99 he wont round up to a 90., Pros-offers SOME extra credit, pushes SOME due dates back\nCons- unintelligible lectures (we go too fast without any depth so all your learning will need to come from self study on DIFFICULT material for CS 147), dodges questions, swamped with HW/quizzes, lectures do not prepare you for the 3 tests, plz take someone else, Initially when I saw the reviews, I thought I was screwed. Surprisingly he was super easy. If you did well in AP CSA or 46A, this class is a breeze. The midterm questions are from in-class exercises so pay attention to them, and the labs were easy as well. He was also the only professor to give out so many practice quizzes. Super accessible too!, Professor Tsao is a nice guy but a terrible professor. His lectures are difficult to listen to and follow due to his thick accent and mumbling. You have to learn everything through reading the Zybooks which is the online textbook. The class itself isnt too difficult as long as you have a decent Java foundation., You will get more out of this class by doing the ZyBook homeworks, watching yt vids.. anything else. He does not teach well; he reads off slides and is not engaging with the content. Labs every week are chill. Midterms are alright, make sure to do the practice ones beforehand. Shouldnt be a hard class with a decent Java understanding., I cant believe I have to rate this professor again. Attendance required online class where he just mumbles on slides with incoherent scribbling and text. TONS of homework, answers on quizzes/midterm reviews arent even right sometimes, doesnt teach you to use the software for projects. Take a summer course or a diff professor if possible., Professor mumbles through lectures which are unclear and often contain errors. Several pop quizzes (1-2 per day) and homework quizzes that can take 1+ hours to complete and cover information not present in the lectures. Projects are fun, but are challenging since they use info not in the lectures. Tests are easy and mostly follow quiz format., In general extremely rude and angry when youre confused by him. I survived this class by watching YT but no one learns anything from his lectures. \n\nLectures are mandatory w/ camera on, he has pop quizzes, mistakes in quizzes, etc., Lectures sometimes have hard content, can be hard to follow because of mumbling + accent. Weekly homework from textbook due every Sunday. 2 midterms, based on textbook, lecture + in class activities. Provides practice midterms. Labs every Friday, 2 lab exams that are on the same week as the midterms. Decently fast response time on canvas emailing., Mumbles in lectures, but very helpful one on one. Homework heavy, but that means your grade will stay up as long as you do the homework. Midterm 1 is similar to in class exercises, the other is purely coding. If you have a good Java foundation or love coding, this class will be easy for you. Weekly labs will solidify your understanding., The class itself was fairly easy, it is just difficult to understand his accent sometimes, making it hard to understand the lectures if you arent paying attention, but the material isnt anything crazy. Sometimes the quizzes have mistakes in them which can get frustrating but he always fixes it and is very generous with points. Just ok, Terrible professor, I am quite surprised that he still allowed to even teach a class at SJSU. Lectures are hard to understand due him mumbling, slides are not helpful and tests are very different than homework. Homework itself takes 5+ hours to complete and is due within a week., HW is graded for participation except the labs and challenge activities. Learned more from HW than from his lectures, which only make sense if you make time to go through them properly. In class activities/quizzes every class for participation points. Many mistakes on his midterm, one lab per week. Connections are important in this class, Mumbles from start to finish, attendance is graded, and 1-3 pop quizzes after each lecture. Some days, we had pop quizzes, HW, and a lab due on the same day on topics we had just covered that week. If you email him with 1-3 questions, he will only answer one at most. Why is he the only instructor teaching CS 147 for an entire year now!?, Absolute nightmare to communicate with in emails and tough to understand in class. You can be super polite in emails to him asking for help but he often takes a really long time actually answering your initial question and then leads you on a wild goose chase wasting a ton of time and asking way more stuff before he actually answers., Keep mumbling. Hard to understand what he wants to say. Not sure why he became an instructor to teach people if he does not have the skill to teach., He mumbles to himself in class, you wont learn anything from attending the mandatory classes for which you will be penalized if you dont attend. You will have multiple pop quizzes every day and homeworks every week. The midterm exam will be extremely long and difficult, of which there will be 2 by the way, and final will be toughest of all. AVOID, Tsao isnt a great lecturer, monotone reading off the slides, but this course is easily doable if you just learn the examples and do a little bit more than provided in class. Exam wise 95% of the material is not foreign, which is pretty good for an upper division CS course. Not the end of the world if you have to take him, he is an average prof., Lectures are boring and there are far too many assignments, where some repeat questions from other assignments. He seems like a nice guy, but as a professor he is at the bottom of the list if I ranked all CS profs Ive taken. If I could go back I would try to take CS147 with someone else., Strong accent, low volume - better to learn through internet/homework/quizzes. A little lenient if you ask nicely. HW: pass/fail, has extra code for auto-feedback. Quizzes: in-class access code, multiple attempts, due midnight. Midterm/final: harder in-class + easier take-home parts, 50/50 point split, most problems are like the homework., HW and quizzes after every class. You have to sit really close to him to understand him, but he does record all his classes. He makes a lot of mistakes in Quizzes and HW instructions.\n\nBut overall he is very caring, listens to students, and gives extensions if required. \n\nIts easy to score an A/A- as long as you do his HW and quizzes religiously., Dude is really hard to understand. Heavy accent, just mumbles to himself during lectures. Instructions often have spelling and grammar errors, HW Submission is really strict. If the timer is one minute over, you get a 0. Be ready to google everything yourself and be bored during class. HW assignments are easy though. Avoid taking, The course is very assignment heavy. There is almost a pop quiz due every day. His lectures are not that great, he forces students to attend by taking attendance in every class. Most of the time I cannot hear or understand what the professor is saying in class. Not recommended., Professor Tsao isnt a bad person, but he does make you question why he teaches at all. He inspires virtually no interest in the topics he teaches, and his lectures dont make much sense. DEFINITELY make sure to communicate with classmates; it will save you, your grade, and your life. Shame that an interesting subject like this is taught so poorly., His accent is very horrible that during his lecture, I cant understand some points of his lecture. The lecture is some kind of straightforward, but you must take your time to understand it clearly. And he always makes mistakes during his lectures and even in midterms and FINAL! However, he always gives the extra work to curve the classs grades., Absolute worst professor ever. Mumbles through lectures, HEAVY accent, has little to no concept of what he is teaching and assigns a pop quiz every lecture. There is also one large lab every week, sloppy mistakes on midterms, not a single person attended the last lecture of the semester lol. Do not take his class., His course is super easy and helpful. I will choose him again, Hi is a very good CS professor. I like his teaching style., Tsao was nice and very accommodating to his students. He extended deadlines and gave extra credit on exams that he knew would be challenging. Overall, solid choice for OS, but its still a difficult subject, so be prepared to do a lot of studying by yourself., His accent is a bit rough but he cares about students learning and passing. He teaches with a very hands on method and A LOT of work. Lectures are literally him running scripts and programming. 65% of your final/midterm is take-home which is great. The workload is very large but really helpful if you want to improve your programming., Doesnt know a thing about teaching or what hes teaching. Makes mistakes on quizzes, tests, etc. But the class is easily passable, as long as you do all the homework and discuss lectures with classmates. Wouldnt recommend him but if nobody is better at least youll pass. You will not learn through unless you self-learn it all., I cant speak for his other classes, but he does NOT know enough of Python to be teaching any Python class let alone ADVANCED Python. He literally has been confused about how to create getters and setters and how to clear dictionaries. What a joke and a waste of my time and money., Doesnt seem to care AT ALL about teaching... Just mutters through the course material. Makes a lot of mistakes throughout his lectures., Hard to understand his lectures. Very vague, but a generous professor who understands your perspective and willing to extend deadlines. Way too much homework in a week., Hes a horrible lecturer, slides and assignments are filled with typos/errors. For lectures he assumes you know everything and even then his explanations are garbage. Easily available outside of class and is actually great in a 1 on 1 environment. For learning, make sure you do office hours with him as much as you can otherwise you wont pass., Professor Tsao is the nicest professor whom I have ever met in SJSU. He does very well in these aspects: 1, Tsaos lectures are logical and particular. 2, He posted his lecture slide at least two day before the class. 3, We can ask him question in every day. No more than 24 hours, he fed back my question on email or discuss with me on Zoom., He is the nicest CS professor in SJSU. He is easily reachable and he will reply to your email very quickly. He gives lots of help with my studies and he is there to help you with your grades. All you need to do is participate and ask questions to help with your studies., First time teacher + Corona time -> confusing + chaotic class. He has no experience doing this. Class is very disorganized and behind. He never managed to cover all the materials. Solution keys for hw, lab, quiz are most of the time wrong, making students confused and lose points. Students complain so much that he provides more than necessary EC., Worst professor Ive ever had (not by choice) and its not even close. Lectures are a mess, fails to answer questions that students ask because he cant elaborate, 23 quizzes, 100pt homework due every week (even during midterms and finals), 2 MIPS projects, changes answer keys for hw/quizzes because WE had to correct his mistakes he made. BEWARE., Horrible professor. Took him for CS 146 and 147. I shouldve learned my lesson the first time around., Professor Tsao is the worst professor I have come across in San Jose State. I have no idea how he got a position in the department. Every lecture is him reading off slides and every HW assignment/quiz had mistakes on almost every question. Expect to learn nothing from him and to self-study everything. Dont make the same mistake I did!, Every single lecture is an unorganized mess of him trying to convey the broadest of concepts in broken english. He is not able to demonstrate his understanding of the subject matter clearly at all. I have no idea how he got into SJSU CS department. 2 semester projects, weekly HWs and pop quizzes, 3 exams. Every lecture feels unprepared with errors., The class got switched to online due to the COVID-19. This professor is new, and he sometimes make some careless mistakes in his lecture, PPT or HW. However, he really knows his stuff. He understands the concept and has solid knowledge of this area. Unfortunately, his English is not that fluent, so sometimes he cannot express in an attractive way., Incoherent lectures, no real order of teaching, just reads off slides, and makes mistakes while reading off slides. Doesnt teach you how to do anything, just expects you to know. Every homework and lab has countless mistakes that are fixed by students. Complete joke of a class. Only take this class if you already know how to do everything., This guy is ridiculous.., What a joke of a class. Cant understand a word he says and constantly goes in loops while lecturing. Tons of mistakes in HW and notes. Has a Lab+HW due every week, even during midterms. All his homework is copy and pasted from god knows where because non of it makes sense. Worst teacher+class Ive taken in SJSU by a mile., This guy cant transfer his knowledge to students and he is confused when he is lecturing. I dont know why SJSU computer department choose him for this important course."
Frank Butt,/professor/115849,2.7,28%,3.5,"Super boring, just reads off slides. Offers no guidance or sympathy. Honestly not sure what he offers as a lecturer/instructor. Questions on tests are worded weirdly, so you need to know what he meant, not what he wrote. Know full stack web dev. If you have little/no knowledge of any of the skills in HW 0, self learn fast or take this class later, Most of this class revolves around the group project. There are weekly scrum meetings where every group goes up and shows their progress. Knowing web dev before taking this class will be useful because you wont learn it from the lectures. The lectures/slides are only needed for the tests+quiz. He allows cheatsheets so make sure to fully utilize em, Only reads off of slides, doesnt teach, or add any insight at all. Extremely boring and unenthusiastic. No clear grading rubric. Gives you cheat sheets for his exams but his exam questions are so random its impossible to prepare/study for. Expects you to learn all the coding on your own for the semester-long group project., Grading feels subjective without a clear rubric. Youll lose a large amount of points for minute and almost pointless things. He only reads of slides, which is completely different than homework., Only reads off his slides, which makes the class very uninteresting., Seemed unprepared, and often read off slides without elaboration, lectures were impossible to pay attention to. Lack of enthusiasm and inability to answer coding questions. Unclear group assignment rubric and overly large group sizes (6+). Relied on Professor Kenwards videos for teaching homework content which was the only learning I did in class., Professor Butt is one of the most outstanding CS professors I have ever had the pleasure to enroll w/ in SJSU; I would recommend his courses but be prepared for the workload as it is not a solo effort. Furthermore, I would say his classes are all about group collaboration. If you plan on taking his courses, be prepared to stress out a lil., Everything about this class is not that great. Hes very harsh when grading quizzes, the lectures dont really do much for you, and the final is worth 40%! He does a small curve at the end, and the easiest part of the class is the HW, and thats difficult in of itself. If you do poorly on the HW, you will fail this class., His assignments are not hard to do but you will be doing lot of self-learning, specifically reading from the textbook. His lecture is dry and his slides are too condensed with information. His quizzes are a bit challenging so make sure you understand the concepts well. So if you can self-learn from the textbook then you will do fine in this class., Im sure hes a nice person, but he sucks as a professor. The slides he put up has way too much information, and sometimes he just straight up shares his screen and reads us the textbook. Both resources are so ancient, and just so hard to digest. Database management is interesting to me, and I really want to be educated, but this class man. REGRET, Taking this class with Prof. Butt, I can say that if you are serious about the class, learning, and material from the first day of lecture, then you should be able to do good, or else you will fail for sure. The final exam is worth 40% of the whole grade. It can make or break your final grade. One positive is that there is heavy curving if needed., i hate my life in this class i wish i could drop!, He just reads off slides and expects you to know everything. HW and exams were difficult., Homework and projects were very hard. Must know C/C++ to do the homework. Tests were heavy with some questions from the lecture. Hell offer some top students in the class internships at IBM so you can accelerate your career if you do well., He warns everyone at the start of the semester, but he was the only one teaching for this class. - dry lectures, he just reads off the textbook - slow at grading - project is long and difficult - 2 quizzes and a final thats worth 40% - MUST know c/c++ pros -I went out of characters, so I cannot write any., keep reading from the textbook for the whole semester, worse instructor even seen, His teaching style of only reading off the textbook is very helpful since I cannot read the textbook myself. Exams, homeworks and projects are very very difficult. Do yourself a favour and never take this guy. Your welcome. Also doesnt record lecture/allow you to record because you can learn more by (?), This was the worst professor I have met in SJSU. He is too lazy. No preparation for class. No slides. No lab instructions. He only read books and didnt provide any practical examples. The quiz and homework were difficult. I only can learn by myself. So sad. Dont take his class!, If you pay attention to lectures and do decent on the project, you should pass with a B. His tests are worded really oddly which throws you off. He writes the tests himself and theyre about small things he mentions during lecture, not really from the powerpoints. Cheat sheets allowed during exam., Horrible prof. Lectures are boring/useless and I never understood what was going on so I stopped going to class. No prep for quizzes which are full of obscure true/false Qs. Lazy attitude and ignores Qs from students he doesnt want to answer. HW seems confusing at first but youll get used to it soon. Only good thing is he extended HW due dates., He just stole lecture slides from this other professor that wrote the textbook. Its so obvious that he just wings his lectures and rambles off of the slides. The only reason people were able to pass his class was because they watched the recorded lectures from the original professor and because he curved the grades by 10% cuz the avgs were so low., For his CS 160 class, hes alright. Make sure you contribute to your 10 week long project really well. Its a great opportunity to learn new tech stack. As for his midterm and final, he lets you have cheat sheets. So make sure to update your cheat sheets each week. If you do those steps, you will most likely get an A., I attended every single lecture. Zoom course, doesnt show face cam. Reads off slides while stuttering and mumbling. Doesnt draw examples, uses Zoom chat to show examples. Doesnt give study material for quizzes or quiz answers once over, tells you to re-watch Zoom recording to figure it out. Forced to figure out asm lang by myself. Scoffs at you., This professor is absolutely horrible. came to class without preparation at all! read off the slides, do no know how to explain, get more confused after asking questions. I had to watch the CMU video lecture to study, and it is way much better! 100% self study, I could describe him with an essay! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I learned more by sleeping than I ever did in lectures. Ignores and talks over questions he doesnt want to answer Assignments are deplorable. No instructions, helps, teaching at all. 40% final. > 60% of your grade is from obscure T/F questions No real teaching. Throwing concepts around, He\s okay. Takes pride in how difficult his other classes are but this class, being a project course, is mostly based on the people you get in your group. He has a pretty good system to form groups with balanced skill sets. You are assigned a project in this course so if you had a specific senior project in mind, it\s not for you., He teaches obsolete information and stuff that do not matter. He mark you down for not answering the wrong answer that he said in class. (If you check the quiz on google you will realize that his answers are wrong) He disabled discussions and comments on canvas to not get any criticism. He is too lazy to change the HW and still uses one from 2008., Professor Butts class is not an easy A class, but you get to learn the some good stuff from him. There are about 5 coding assignments. If you are a hard worker, he is there to answer to your questions through emails and during office hour. Be prepared to put in right amount of effort if you want to do well., Hes overall a pretty chill and easy prof. The whole class is a project and two tests. He allows multiple sheets to refer to during the tests. The project is alright. As long as you get down the basic requirements needed for the project and do alright in your tests you should expect a high grade in his class. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND, Responsive to my many emails, questions during class. Projects is great at helping you learn code. Must come to office hours bc that is where he explains the project in detail. Assembly is hard but once you go the hang of it (reading the textbook helps!!!) its fun. Some ppl even said they like assembly during office hr. Great class!, You get what you put in. If you go to office hr, he spends time there explaining projects in detail. Very clear after going to them. It takes effort for him to be sitting at 9pm doing office hrs. Coding must be studied alongside lectures. Read textbook (especially ch3 and understand the code)! I was lost, but after reading that, I caught up., Cs47 is so much content, its hard to cover only in lecture. Students must read textbook in addition to lec to understand. Prof Butta lec give you a head start in reading. His projects after you do them correctly makes you pro at assembly. Testing is very fair. Reads emails. This is what is expected of a good professor. Thank Professor Butt!, Professor Butt is the worst professor that Ive had at SJSU so far. His homework problems come with little to no instructions. His lectures are so nondescriptive and he gives a more confusing answer to your question when you ask. He seems as if he has no idea what he is teaching. Ive never been so lost in a class. He really shouldnt be teaching., Prof Butt is great! Must read textbook, but Prof Butt uses lecture to go through what you should be reading. It makes reading much easier! Doesnt read from slides, but explains it. Stays lively throughout whole lecture. Grading very clear, tests what he teaches, extremely fair. Puts in time outside of class to answer emails and office hr. Awesome!, Prof Butt is fair, tests only what he covers, grading system is reasonable, some projects. Must read the textbook to fully understand lecture and how to code. If u read,this class is reasonable and fair. Prof Butt is clear on what he tests and on project requirements. Course is very useful!covers assembly behind C and comp basics. Study C! Take him, This was a project based class. Pray you dont have slackers on your team since it is random., The guy cant teach. He reads off those textbook slides. He has his full time job at IBM and dont care about students. There is a group project which is expected for this class, but no direction or mentorship. He does not take attendance, but it is mandatory otherwise you lose points on the scrum meetings. Avoid, His lectures are boring and not interesting. He does not put any effort into his class. Very laid back. Occasionally late or let students out early.... not a good professor., Attendance is kind of mandatory for scrum meetings, but outside of that, not really. He does take attendance in all his classes though. He definitely puts more effort in to his upper division classes over his lower division classes. Fairly laid back for 160, let classes out early to watch warrior games, Material was vague and based on textbook. To be honest, I didnt learn anything new or practical. Both projects and the midterm are tough, but the final is relatively easy. Fortunately, at the end he put a big curve that is bigger than the curve on the EARTH LOL. That makes up for the toughness., Wouldnt take it again with him even for a million dollars. Taught abs nothing whole semester. If you didnt do nothing in the projects, you learned nothing in the class. No ppts, no lectures. Gives assignment teaches nothing on how to do it. Self taught class, no need to come to class. wasnt ready for class. lots of hws expect work., Always come to class unprepared and brag about his job at IBM. His lecture is pointless, only about his life stories nobody cares. Yeah we get it you work for IBM, so what? Doesn\t automatically qualify you become a good professor. Please resign from SJSU and stop ruining our future. No wonder IBM is going downhill with a senior manager like him, Excellent teacher with extensive industry experience. The CS47 class will learn a lot of assembly code and learning a lot about bits and bytes, memory representation, hierarchy, etc. His lecture can be a little unorganized especially when he writes on the board (not necessarily left to right). Tests are tricky but he lets you use notes and book., Professor Butts teaches practical programming skills.    His assignments are meaningful, the time I spent working on them paid off at my work. I impressed my boss by  code optimization. Lectures are informative  grading is fair. I hope to take another his class before graduation in 2016., Materials discussed in class will be tested in midterms and final. Programming assignments are time consuming, make sure ask him questions about them before it is too late. Lecture is fast and confusing. Cover less materials than the other course. We wasted 2 class time to watch a movie and discuss it. Not irrelevant. Textbook is lightly used., It was good chance to learn real tool for IBM. Class was not hard programming project as easy and Grading was fair., Cool prof, but labs are really hard and time consuming. Hws are based on power point slides. Though the project is really interesting; you need to start on it right away. I also liked his motivational personal stories. Fair grader., good lecturer. info is presented clearly and succinctly. tests arent easy, but mostly fair aside from a little bit of trickiness. subject info from lectures is what youre tested on(no surprises). he curves. funny., What I heard about him is not true. In fact, this semester he wants to pass everyone, even better gives good grades. Believe it or not, easy A+. HW1 is kind of tricky; HW2 is super easy. 2 Mids are not very hard, but final is almost identical to mids. Project is heavy and hard, but to me it is the best one at cs dept. Highly Recommend!, I do recommend you to take his class. Very clear presentation; very knowledgeable and useful course., Very challenging projects. Easy HWs but Tricky exams. Calm going, very pleasant, never saw him bad tempered. Quite approachable. Can make the class a little interactive and interesting., I do recommend you to take Butts class if you need a grade: labs are the hardest things during the semester assigned and graded by his grader. You will have 3 quizzes (midterms but he calls them quizzes)and the final(40%). You will not know your grade anytime during the semester until you they are posted in mysjsu.Surprise grader, ended up with B., His exams are meant to be tricky tricky. This guy will read straight from the book every lecture. His lecture is boring - no lecture plan, no slide, no prep at all. Got -A from reading the book and learned myself. Terrible teacher., Unprepared Lectures:  He stares at the book for two minutes, writes something on the board, says 10 words or less and stares at the book for two minutes again.  First quiz was open book / open notes with 10 questions (7 Mult. Choice) and it still took the fastest person 1.5 hours to finish.  Book is worthless.  HW and Final were OK.  Enjoy!, Excellent and challenging projects.  Final exam is tough but grades are curve.  Heavy workload thoughout the semester.  Weak students usually drop out early so you are competing with good students all semester., If you can not write well in C/C++, dont take his class. His projects make you craze and sleepless, but he lets most students pass his class, He cant teach. He simply reads off those textbook slides. And the reason his midterm and quizzes are difficult is because they consist of mainly true/false questions. Makes teaching look easy. The only challenging part of his course was his projects., Make sure no have no more than 12 units or you will be in trouble. Will make you work but will learn a lot., Lots of experience makes him very knowledgeable and his class was very rewarding"
Robert Chun,/professor/216637,4.2,60%,3,"This class is easy, as long as you go to class and study, easy A., This class is phenomenal. Take this class and you wont regret it!, Horrible behavior by this professor who grades people who behave flirtatiously and are intrusive, hardworking people who diligently work are not recognised, but people who do over action and sycophantic or someone whose outward personality he likes, gets high marks even though they put low efforts, its highly condemnable in academic circles, Good professor and a clear communicator. Two exams, averages this year were 82 and 80, if I recall correctly. Final exam is just writing about 6 student presentations at the end of the semester. He tells you to study for six papers but tests you on the three you know the best.\n\nNo attendance required, first 8 weeks are all prerecorded lectures., Worst professor at San Jose state! Purposefully keeps the lectures online even though the campus is fully open. Not much was learned through the course and the worst grading criteria for all the assignments and exams., Great lecturer and the best option for CS147. If you attend his lectures and do the few homework problems he gives it will be enough for the tests., Professor doesnt put effort in creating new homework, midterm or final questions. He has been using the same slides, midterm questions since 2013. So it is an easy course if someone asks around. The course needs to be updated with 2022 level syllabus rather than 2013.\nAlso, the grad course and the undergrad course uses the same material LOL., I loved the structure of Chuns Parallel Processing class. The first half of the semester we go over basic parallel processing (also a rehash of CS 147/149). The second half is only student presentations on a plethora of topics. Basically every student can do a presentation on anything related to PP. The final was just writing about 3 presentations, Pros: Organized and amazing lectures, clear and soothing voice, one has to follow his lecture sheets for the midterms. Replies to e-mails. Cons: Very tough grader. No extra credit option., Hes very experienced in his subject of computer architecture. The course itself requires lots of reading and Dr Chun tries his best to cover it all in his lectures. His quizzes are not easy. I thought he was very organised with his lecture slides and presentations., Professor is good. No weekly assignments. Two project assignments throughout the course and a midterm exam and final exam. Overall course structure is easy., Very organized, clear lectures. Notes are exhaustive and the two assignments are easy., Good teacher. Easy grades., Great Professor! Every lecture was very clear and easily comprehensible.  He summarizes his previous lecture before he starts class . The questions in the 2 Assignments for the semester can be answered if we understand his lectures., TERRIBLE AVOID him by all means. He never answers his email and he is so mean if luckily he answers. His exams is so long and not easy to answer all questions in a limited period of time.Students who can answer have sample exams from before.Even he is not a good grader. I got different score from your classmate from the identical answers!!!!!, He is one of the most organized professors on the campus,cristal clear lectures along with easy projects. For midterms and final, make sure you memorize everything from his notes. He has such soothing voice, which will make you go to sleep the first couple of weeks, but you will get used to it., I like him, the first few weeks seemed slow, but as we progressed i started enjoying the material. Professor Chun really knows the material, dont even bother buying the book. The entire class is based on his lecture notes (cant stress enough). Make sure you cover everything from his lecture notes for the midterm. Get a head on the projects., Chun is THE best professor! His lectures are extra clear. He has this calm zen surrounding him. He always smiles his signature smile. He cares about his students. Show up to class everyday and ask him questions if youre stuck. Youll enjoy his class. This guy knows what hes talking about. His exam is long and challenging., Excellent professor.  His lectures are very clear, and he really cares that students are learning and understand the material.  His test are really long, but if you go to class everyday and do the projects youll be fine., The best professor in CS department. Go for the FPGA project option (and not paper) and you will never regret it in terms of experience, knowledge and grade!! Have his previous exams if possible. Very nice person!!, Pros:He is by far the most organized professor and conducts the class in professional manner.Very patient and helpful.The presentations required by the students help in learning new topics. Cons: The lectures tend to be little bit on the boring side but if we follow the lectures then there wont be any surprises on the midterms or the finals., He only taught for the last few weeks of my class in place of Teoh, but he is good.  Chun is an old style teacher, even his handouts look like theyve been typed up on a type-writer.  Hes clear, easy to understand, and easy to learn from.  Do the homework, and you should be fine.  Lectures are a bit on the boring side, though., Only advise- have his old tests. He follows the patterns.Tests are very long and conceptual, but if u know the patterns from the old tests then only, u can finish it and try some of the new materials. Final was like a book. But chun is a very good teacher. Pay attention to his every word., Professor chun is very clear on his lectures.I love his teaching style, But I have one advise for the students , dont take any make up exam. He will make your life miserable with the make up exam.Do the exam on time.He will give 1 1/2 equal weight of actual exam ., Dr. Chun has very clear notes and detailed explanation about the topics he covers in class. Noone can teach as clear and fun as him in the CS dept. He makes the most difficult subject as easy as possible. When you go to his office hour, he will help you with all his heart., One of the best professors. His teaching is very clear and helpful. Makes the subject very interesting. It was always fun to be in this class and learn the subject., He is very helpfull and understanding. One of the most organized professors in CS Dept. I love him!!, One of the best teachers in the CS department, if not the best one. He has a course reader that is pretty much your class notes, so you get everything on paper and all you have to do is listen to him. His lectures are very clear too. His exams are hard because they are long, but if you did the homework it should be doable., Good professor. Lectures are very clear and concise. Hardly used the book at all, material either from lecture or from course reader. He grades based on understanding of concepts rather than memorization, lots of partial credit from this.  Tests are long but definitely doable. Highly recommended., only complaint is that the tests are too long to finish, easy to make mistake on those algorithms where if you mess up somewhere in the middle, the whole thing/ answer is wrong. Even if you know how to do it, the pressure to finish in time and not look at it twice could cost you. Thats the only thing I did not like, he is a very good teacher., If you need someone to hold your hand through concepts, Chun is your guy.  His lectures are very well done... he breaks things down to very basic levels.  If youre smart, this can be boring at times, as he explains in depth something that is pretty easy to grasp. His tests are long, and he has a tendency to throw some things that you dont expect., Extremely clear, thorough, and helpful, Dr. Chun is extremely well-prepared every lecture (he uses largely the same course handout every semester).  Some of the verbage (line printers?  tape drives?) is a bit archaic, but the concepts are solid.  Tests are very long and wordy, but not too tough if youve kept up.  Best prof Ive had at SJSU so far., Chun is a excellent lecturer. Takes the time to explain concepts in good detail. His first project is VERY long, the second is half of the first one, and the last one is thrown in the mix right before finals (1/5 size of first), but all are the same weight. Exams are REALLY REALLY long and can be tricky, study notes. Graded harshly (little partial), He rocks... Chun teaches extremely well. Compared to Dr. Lee he is like a breath of fresh air to learn from. Very clear, knowledgable and intelligent. I have learned a lot about operating systems in this class., poor teaching, poor grading. pretentious. course graded by the curve, which does benefit all if you put in the necessary effort., Very clear lecturer. Although topics seem complex, breaks them down and takes time @ beginning of each lecture to review material from previous. Tests are really long but not too hard if you study; they do require some memorization. Grader for this class was really bad, though. You wont need to buy the text, since everythings in his $6 notes., Took his class in 04. I am soon to graduate now, and I must say, this was the worst prof ever. All the other CS staff is outstanding, even the latest additions are extremely bright., Great teacher. Great person. Tough class but he prepares you if you study and do the hw., Organized lectures, very knowledgable, but can be quite boring sometimes. Tests are very long, but not too hard if you review and grasps all the concepts from his lecture notes. Overall, very effective teacher. I would take this teacher again for another class., Probably the best CS professor in this department, Dr. Chun is a very knowledgable and helpful professor.  You do not need to take very many notes because they are provided to you.  His tests are very difficult.  His final is practically impossible; if it wasnt on the midterms, it will be on the final!, THE best professor in the Computer Science Department...Tests are difficult but they test wheather you really know the subject...Extermely helpful and speaks very clearly...Extreme patience, Hes better than the average professor, but his lectures can get quite boring.  His exams are quite tough as well.  Try answering the questions in an outline form (not complete sentences) or else you wont have enough time to finish., very professional. One of the best professors in CS department, Great teacher! Very professional! Tests are killer but graded easily., His presentation is all slides. Every slide he uses is in his workbook or is passed out.  The trick to doing well in his class is to take rigorous notes even though he practically reads from the slides.  Very boring lectures and very boring style., Extremely polished and preofessional presentations.I learned a lot., He has to be the best CS teacher there is in this department. He gives a clear presentation, which helps one learn the material. And his exams are difficult and long!!!"
Jeff Smith,/professor/94606,2.5,N/A,3.5,"Avoid at all costs save your time take another professor., Extremely dry and boring lectures that are not easy to follow, even when youre interested in the subject. Tests and homework were not bad, and he grades very fast. But I think he only gave one A in the whole class. Lowest grade Ive received in any CS class ever (of 20 taken) despite considerable effort. Avoid., Not particularly interesting, entire class pretty much zones out on laptops / phones while he teaches in a fairly mundane matter...then he shoots up about 3 octaves to get your attention. Definitely not an exciting teacher nor very helpful. Mostly vague in everything, but not the hardest / worst Ive seen, Some people see classes as places with students against the teacher. Thats how this teacher seems to see it. He really needs to let it go. There may be something about his lectures that could use some work.. but all I can focus on is how I get to sit in his class and see him slam his stick to get peoples attention, comfy with this state of things, kind effective teacher; covered subject matter well (most of the time); no trauma, no drama, reasonable tests, reasonable homework, reasonable grading; does all grading himself so he can gauge how everyones doing; very smart guy - one of the best in the dept; should change the text tho.  He was happier than we were that the class ended - funny, Hes alright. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. His assignments are easy. His instructions are unnecessarily convoluted and complex. His exams are from the material that he explicitly covered in class. His lectures are boring. He wants to make sure you understand the topics though. Helpful during question time. Somewhat socially awkward.., basically its a very hard class. the subject matter can be very difficult but he teaches it well. Hes willing to help explain further concepts. A lot of hw but its extremely helpful when it comes to exams. (time consuming but worth it!) Exams can be hard but if u pay attention in class and understand the hw u should be okay., This is not a easy class, but if you are willing to learn, you will learn quite a lot from his class. His lectures are so clear and detailed and he is very helpful and pertty fair in grading., The most demotivating professor I have ever come across. He tries to be hard on students in every way possible. Not a good study experience. Try to avoid him but since he teaches this course most of the time it might be hard to do so. So, GOODLUCK!! :), Thorough organized clear lectures.  Very good notes.  Very fair open book tests. Prompt return of homework assignments and tests. Prompt email responses. Reads every line of programming assignments and provides helpful comments. Very fair grading.  I dont expect to be entertained by an instructor, I expect to be taught - and he does this very well, Prof. Smith is extremely helpful during his office hours and more than willing to spend however much time is needed to answer your questions. The book is heavily used, and it is strongly suggested to read it thoroughly. Open-book/note tests force you to have a very clear understanding of the material., Hes very book oriented. If youve read the book before the exams, youll do fine because anything he puts on the test, you can use the book. Harsh grader on the programs though., This is teacher is so unclear. His lectures are boring, his words didnt make any sense. Cant explain clearly what he wants on the assignments. Harsh grader, strict as hell. Exams are open book and open notes but his Exams will go beyond these the material. Suggestion: Dont take his class no matter what, try to find some other teachers if possible., Hes so pedantic, so clear, and so precise during his lectures; it becomes quite hard to stay awake. On the contrary, if youre able to stay awake, and are willing to learn, youll probably learn quite a lot. Attendance is not required, but highly recommended. Tests can be challenging. Recommended., DO NOT TAKE HIM! He does not explained the subjects clear, and he went beyond the book. Almost one and half chapter per week, lots of reading and homework. Open book and open notes for the midterms and final, but its hard. Hes not helpful during the office hour, he cant tell where I made the mistakes on the hw. Take someone else if you can!!, No curve. Open book midterms and final. You need to do all the hw to do good in the class. Lectures arent too clear. You have to read most of the book to do well. His slides has some good points, but are not great at all. He tells jokes, but arent funny., Smith is my favorite professor Ive had at SJSU.  Hes an extremely smart guy, and his I always found his lectures to be clear and helpful.  Im convinced that thinking his lectures are boring is a symptom of not paying close enough attention., Exams and assignments are very unclear, lectures are boring and unorganized. Requires a lot of reading by yourself if you wanna pass the class. Do not take him unless you are familiar with the course material., His lectures are torture - very long, dry, and unorganized. His exams and programs can be tricky, only because he chooses to communicate in an unclear uncommited manner. As a result of taking this class, I feel that I can pick up any new language and start writing programs within a few days., Lectures tend to be longwinded and not very well-organized. He doesnt seem to fully appreciate the steep learning curve in functional and logic programming (problem with the course itself, actually). Strongly recommend taking CS154 before doing 152. The book (Loudens) is awful. Be prepared to consult outside sources to fully learn the material., Exams are mostly from what he teaches in the class.Homework and test grading is tough,you will lose lot of points for small mistakes,but the tests are easy.Does not curve much.Textbook for this class(Hopcroft)is useless so need to do lot of searching over the internet to get reasonable explanation., Boring lecturer. His test are easy. tests are open book and he gives a lot of partial credit., not clear, hard to understand, tests not to hard,, boring, difficult to understand, does not like to accommidate students needs, Not clear in lectures, but very organized. Follow the assignments and his tests guidelines, you will learn a lot. His materials are no ****. Also keeps the archive of his past tests: very helpful. Responds through mail very promptly., This guy is a cs students nightmare. His assignments are vague and easily misunderstood despite being pedantically worded, hes a tough grader, and somebody really needs to tell him to stop speaking geek. The best advice I can give is: DONT TAKE HIM!, Very hard on grading programs. Even though you get it right he still will take 15% off as miscelaneous deductions. Tests are easy. Homeworks assignments are worth 50% of the grade. Will not ever take him again. Text book is one of the worst I, Bad professor, not clear, Will not take class with him again. Unfair in grading, hard to understand. Cannot stand for himself., OK overall. Programs are graded hard, and hes not clear in his directions. Tests are graded easy, and doable, even though you will not really know what he will test on. The Weiss text will really not help you, so dont miss the class., cant understand what he is talking about. I tot i was alone but found out that others are experiencing the same thing. the subject was pretty fun but his lecture was awful. i could sit for 1hr15mins and was totally lost all the time.hard grader!!!, This instructor seems to have a very low self-confidence, and compensates for that through authoritarian rule. He is rude, condescending, and not helpful. When asked a question about grading, his stock answer is I don\t know. Avoid this profes, His assignments are very vague.  You dont know what he really wants!  His grading is very picky and his exams are abstract.  Hes not very helpful and hes very unclear.  Also, his leactures are VERY BORING., Challenging assignments, not difficult if you are comfortable with prerequisite material.  Pay attention to guidelines for documentation.  Tests are comprised of examples and material presented in class., never ever take any CS course with this clown. his teaching is a joke. well, not really. none of us were laughing when he failed us, Hard teacher.  Class was boring.  Assignments were confusing.  Tests were ok, but only because they were open book., Lousy commnunicator.  Even defensive.  His assigmemnt descriptions are very odd.  Most students had difficutlies in decyphering what the hell he wanted.  If you dont know java already, the DONT take this guy., Didnt seem too interested in helping, assignments can be kind of hard. He isnt clear on his assignments, and sometimes ran into problems because of mistakes he made., His lecture is very boring.  Very strict on grading.  If you are the one who can study through self-study, it may be ok to take his class.  Otherwise, do not take it., A little too easy, but I learned a lot from programs., programs were really hard and i was lost the whole semester. tests were ok tho cuz they were open book. i failed the class cuz the programs are worth more., Programs are pretty difficult and hes very strict on grading. Exams are easier, and they are also open book., Hard programs, easy test. each 50% of grade.. CS coordinator - good, Very good. Knows his stuff."
Mark Stamp,/professor/281383,4.4,88%,2.7,"Speaks soft/quiet so its difficult to hear in larger classes. Sometimes better to just watch the recordings for clearer speech. Otherwise good lectures, since he wrote the textbook. Lots of difficult hw, often with little explanation from graders (also inconsistent). Tests are much easier (and graded easier) than hw and follow the review closely., Great professor, gives weekly/almost weekly homework that the tests are based on. Willing to work with students in office hours or online in the forums. Exams are paper, no notes/cheat sheets and are 75% of the grade, but you can be prepared with just homework and slides. If you attend class and do homework, hard not to get a B., He is one of the best teachers Ive seen at this school: great lectures, and clear grading criteria. The homework assignments are lengthy, but as long as one starts them on time and puts in the effort, its doable. Dont be put off by the difficulty - if you want to learn machine learning properly, this is a must-take course., Weekly HWs (just right combination of mathematical proofs and hands-on coding implementation for the ML algorithms), frequent pop-up quizzes (really helpful to go deep at least once with nitty-gritty of numerical solving by hands), term project (proposal and presentation) and a group final (real highlight of CS271, collaborative and competitive)!, Great lectures, but gives homework every week. Grading is fair with lots of emphasis placed on the weekly assignments and the course projects., Amazing Professor. Took both his classes. Explains very well and has a lot of experience in the security field. Weekly assignments., If you are interested in Information security, this class would be really helpful.  Good: Prof. Stamp explains concepts really well. His book is really well written.  Tough: He talks slow. Homeworks and projects are demanding.  Overall, really good experience., He speaks really slow and takes forever to get to the point.  It bores the class so nobody rarely participates.  Hes ok to just call on the same males in the class., One of the amazing professor SJSU CS dept has. His classes will never be boring. Started loving security after this class. Projects will be very interesting. Every week will be having homeworks.  Midterms and final will be easy if you do your homeworks properly., Very good professor. Weekly homework of reasonable difficulty, which he goes over when its due. He wrote the textbook and knows his stuff., Organized and clear lectures., Cool Professor. Lecture is very clear and projects are reasonable. Grading is fair. This class might help you job interview., Great Professor and a humble divine soul. Took Ad. Software Security class with him. Loved the way he teaches and his genuine interest in his students success. I also ended up doing my thesis under him. Always eager to help his students., Mark Stamp is an asset to this department. He is one of the best teachers at SJSU. The text we used was his own. The book and his lecture notes are extremely clear. You dont need to come to class, but I highly recommend it. The homework questions are hard, but the tests are easy compared to that, so hope you get an easy grader., One of the best professors. Makes the class extremely simple and fun. Teaches from scratch. Fair with grading, This was software reverse engineering. First semester for this course. Mark has a great passion for the subject and this comes across. Assignments and final are extremely challenging but if you are prepared to work hard you will learn a lot. Lectures are always interesting and he values input from his students. Highly recommended., Excellent professor and person!! Do the homework regularly and the exams will be easy!, As every student says, he is awesome. His material is very concise. Attend the class and do homework. Answer questions in class and would not be shameful if he does not know answer. His class is highly recommended., THIS IS THE BEST CLASS EVER!!! :D :D :D :D, Excellent Prof.. learned a lot in his course, Awesome prof! Ive had him before for Java and still has the same humor which makes class enjoyable. Every lecture is packed with info and slides provided online help supplement them.  Exams arent too challenging, just study well and do the homework, youll do fine., Although he doesnt know much java, he is a very good professor and I would highly recommend him for any CS class. He focuses more on the data structures and leaves figuring out the code to you., What a course!! Amazing Prof and excellent course. He knows every nook and corner of the subject and has complete command on what he is speaking. Funny, friendly, suggests as per necessity, responds promptly to mails. A student cant ask for anything more! Do not miss out his course! Impressive., A Cool and fun teacher. 10 homework assignments, 2 midterms, and 1 final. they all determine the grade. Office hours are very helpful., CS 161 is elective, but it should be required for anybody who wants to code in real world! This is the most practical, interesting, challenging and plain useful class Ive taken. You can take the knowledge and use it at your job for YEARs to come. Mark Stamp is very good lecturer!, This is one of the best professor I ever seen in my life. Excellence !!!!, very nice professor. If you work on the assignments regularly you can get good grades, Ok teacher, witty humor.  Tests are based on homework and lectures, pretty easy.  First time teaching Java, he did alright., One of the best instructors at SJSU. Extremely organized, clear and helpful. However, the first 2 midterms and all 9 homeworks were challenging. Final exam was not cumulative and relatively easier than the previous material. Great class, great teacher... youll learn a lot!, Information Security class was the most useful elective Ive taken. There was so much material covered, that it was a bit overwhelming. I would hope this class eventually can be split in A and B section so we can do a bit more coding. Im already in the industry and this is by far the most relevant class to real live., I had one of my most memorable classes with Dr. Stamp.  He is very knowledgable, fair, and prompt.  If the departement could offer other courses with him, it would have had great achievements for university and the students., That class was really awesome. The only fault is that the class tries to condence an awful lot of material into 15 weeks. But Dr. Stamp does an excellent job of hitting all the important points. If you have a chance, TAKE THIS CLASS!, The worst professor I have ever taken a class.He does not give the answers of the homework. No review for final and he gives a very hard final. No idea what kind of final we are getting . Tough grader, The curriculum taught in CS158B is not at all helpful in the industry.  Unfortunately Professor Stamp has to teach it and it makes the class very dull.  He is an overall nice guy, but I felt like I wasted an entire semester on useless information.  Overall easy teacher, but if you want to learn something useful for your career I suggest Melody Moh., Easy class if you study. Pay special attention to his lecture. Things he repeats many times are homework or exam questions. His industry experience keeps the content of this class fresh. A good practical class to take., Great class. Good professor with alot of experience and willingness to teach. Takes most of the details and mathmatics out and presents the main ideas. Very straightforward exams, although some homework problems are hard. Stamp will usually answer your emails within 15 min of sending them., Enjoyed the class very much. Professor likes the subject a lot and its much better than most CS classes. Professor is open and responsive to questions in class and doesnt mind people making a few jokes, too. But be aware of the slow asian kids in the back who ask stupid questions., Taking the same class at the previous poster, expect to find lonely nerds in the class, and they will ask some dumb a** questions and sometimes answer YOUR questions. Overall easy grader, do your HW and youll be fine. The white dude who sits in the front sucks., Good class, but theres this one annoying white dude who sits in the front of the class who wont shut the F*CK UP -- otherwise all 5s, Horrible prof. doesnt care about the students future. Expects us to have his level of knowledge. Grading is strict. gives a lot of homeworks .Keeps the semester busy., Very, very knowledgable. He worked for the NSA for 13 years.\n nuff said., lectures are clear & well organized. if you dont study regularly his weekly quizes can pull your grade down. he likes to ask questions about networking stuff details so you have to have good memory. easy grader. lots of partial credits :), His lectures are clear and tries his best to make you understand. Unfortunately, he is not up-to-date with current networking technology, since he is a security expert--worked at NSA. Plus his exams test you on how much youve memorize."
Benjamin Reed,/professor/2426648,3.8,68%,4.1,"Here is my advice for taking his class: \n\nDONT., Ben is a great prof and you can feel his enthusiasm during lectures. Homework isnt bad but is graded on accuracy and not completion so you definitely cant afford to procrastinate (I did and my grade suffered lol). Exams were straightforward and a lot easier than the homework and will easily carry your grade. Overall the class was very rewarding., Ben is a good professor but his class is not for slackers. His assignments are quite difficult and will take a lot of your time throughout the semester. But if you do have the time and interest to put in a lot of work, you will get a lot out of his class. Personally, I found his class to have a steep learning curve but I dont regret taking him., I find Ben very inspiring and easy to understand. He starts his class with questions and uses iClicker to practice. Hes available outside class, and his office hours are easy to attend.\nThis platform is for rating my professor, so my review is solely for the professor, not OS as a course. The OS class itself is a headache., Professor Reed isnt a bad professor, but the way the operating systems course was taught for CMPE felt overwhelming. The assignments felt like they were unbelievably hard, and at times would feel like it was impossible to complete them at the pace that they were given, which felt like there was no breathing room. The autograder wrecked the grades., As an upper-division class, preparation & independence are expected. Some students may find that they need to catch up others find the class easy. I give code examples for assignments and start off class with time for questions about the assignments. Few students took advantage of it. Preparation & independence prepare students for career success., For CS158A. Prof. Reed is my favorite professor at SJSU. Decent lecturer but his slides arent very clear; however, if you go to his office hours for help he will write you a book of everything you need to know. Extremely friendly and willing to help. No curve balls on exams but the final was pretty tough. Sad to see him go to the CMPE department., Ben is one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subjects, and he shows through his actions that he cares about his students and likes his job.\n\nTests are very straightforward and fair. Homework assignments are difficult, but that is due to the content of the class being difficult., OS lives up to its notoriety as being one of the most challenging courses that CS students may take. I had a study group, went to office hours, read the book, took notes during class, and turned in labs early. Reed is on your side, but you have to put in the work to get the grade you want. Go to his office hours, he is on your team., Make sure to treat the assignments like projects because they basically are! Great guy: knowledgable, accessible, and helpful., I like the enthusiasm he has for the class. Very knowledgeable. I think that the way he explains things are clear and easy to understand most of the time. I think some of the 6 programming assignments are a bit too lengthy and could be overwhelming at times (although he does give you a lot of time), Hes a caring professor and a nice person overall, however the class is is incredibly difficult and time consuming. Although he says, knowing C is not required, you will have to be extremely comfortable with C to do well on his homework assignments. Just going to lecture wont help; read all the txtbook chapters he assigns and self learn., Nice guy but he deos not care about students who genuinely bring up issues to him for consideration., This class was a little difficult but if you care enough to try it is not impossible to get a good grade. The hardest part about the class was the individual assembly assignments, however, you can ask questions and he will help you understand how to get the solution. All of the exams had very clear study guides that made studying easier!, OS is one of the hardest and a core class in the CS major, although I dropped the class due to my own problems. Ben is one of the great professors I ever had at SJSU. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate to teach his students. The difficulty of the subject is the reality of the CS Major that you have to learn it and go through it., This is the first time that Prof. Reed has taught this class, and so far he has done a poor job. He gives out assembly language coding assignments while barely teaching us assembly language in the lectures; instead, he mostly focuses on concepts being covered in the textbook. I wish that he would cover the specific content of the assignments more., i barely teach assembly. its not an assembly class. we cover a super small subset for the projects. there not too much to say about MOV, ADD, SUB, JNZ, and JMP, the main ops for the projects, but i did spend multiple lectures on them. the difficulty comes from applying the concepts you learn to the projects. thus, i focus on the concepts., Difficult content, and the expectations for this class are very high. To succeed, youll need to read the textbook , spend a lot of time on homework assignments (that are mini projects by themselves), and ask a lot of questions. Falling behind results in snowballing. If youre willing to put in the effort, youll learn a ton in this class., He is always eager to teach, but because this course is really dense, it is hard to cover everything. If you have trouble understanding something, ask and he will explain in more detail. The coding assignments are heavy projects and require a lot of time. Tests are based off ungraded homework questions, so try to pay attention to those. Nice guy., You will learn a lot, the class is difficult, but if you ask, he WILL help you. Project is great, you apply EVERYTHING you learn. Office hours are extremely helpful. He gives you exactly what you need to study for tests. In my 4 years of college, this was my favourite class. Ben is approachable and caring if you show you care about the class., The class teaches you to drive remote-controlled cars, and homework asked you to drive Transformers. He just only read textbooks and just only used #C. every assignment is not he did grade., wow! that sounds like a cool class! unfortunately, we don\t do remote-controlled cars. transformers would be even more awesome. we also use C not C# for the projects. we do have a grader that grades the programming assignments. the ungraded homework is a study guide for the exams and is not graded (it\s in the name ;) )., Best cs professor at sjsu! you will use what you learn from him in industry. Ben is very informational and will help you understand everything, he really goes above and beyond for students. Assignments can be hard but if you want to learn they are fun, I agree with the people who say hes a nice guy. But he also has no consideration for whether or not his students can complete his assignments. I even went to his office hours when I was nearly failing the class and he was completely unresponsive. So yeah, he might be a nice guy but that doesnt mean hes a good teacher., He has current, in-depth knowledge about distributed systems, but is quite absent-minded. His class was structured poorly though (maybe because its the first time he took it). We had a lot of papers to read, and the projects were very difficult. I wish I had worked much more harder, would have got a better grade. He doesnt curve on grades btw!, CS149 was def a highlight of my semester. Ben made the class interesting, and inspired me to learn more and o more. His exams are not to hard if you are study for it using his homework, yet the programming assignments do require a good understanding, so dont procrastinate, start early and ask him questions., I really don\t understand the review that complains about the PROFESSOR being too smart, as if that\s a bad thing (c\mon people). It\s as if people want easy As without learning any real career skills. Yes, the tests were hard, yes the homework was hard. But Ben was there every step of the way, and clearly made sure we would finish successful., This professor is super nice, knowedgable and funny. Class is pretty hard, but hell help you get through it. If you dont understand something, ASK! Programming assignments are somewhat on your own, make sure to do the homework, and make a lot of friends/study groups. Subject is definitely hard, but bens a great teacher., Do homeworks early since you will struggle researching on your own. Read the textbook and answer the questions he gives on canvas (gives you a good idea of whats on the exam). Pay attention when he writes on the board. Attending class is a very good idea - since there are no slides for you to reference later on. No pop quizzes. Office hours, go., If you dont work for your grade - youll get a low score. You have to put effort in teaching yourself and pay attention in class because it helps for hw and tests. Ben has a lot of work experience and will teach you USEFUL stuff. He has a lot of office hours - dont hesitate to ask him. DONT do homework last minute (< 5 days) :) pls. I regret., Wow, I am really surprised to see bad reviews. Ben is an exceptional teacher, who has TONS of relevant work experience and teaches you things you will actually use in your career. I wish all my classes could be taught by him - he works very hard to help you learn the subject, has a lot of office hours, and genuinely cares about your success., One of the best classes that I took at SJSU. Bens an amazing professor who is passionate about teaching OS and does his best for students to excel in his class. Hes always available whenever you need help. This class is challenging but worthwhile to take if you want to learn about OS. I feel motivated and inspired by him. Thanks Ben :), Bens such a great professor Ive ever met. Hes also a great inspiration to many students. He always wants his student to learn something and do well not only during class but also after class (interview, job, etc.) His homework is hard, but you will gain tons of knowledge out of it. If you want a good grade, you need to earn it. Nothing is free!, Oh my gosh, Ben is AMAZING! Hes such a phenomenal lecturer, incredibly passionate, super engaging and energetic. He kept me awake when other teaches couldnt. Its clear OSs are his passion and he genuinely wants you to succeed. Even though the material was challenging, Ben always provided us with more than enough resources to succeed. 12/10!, Super passionate about teaching OS. Replaces lowest exam with final and opportunities for extra credit. Office hours EVERY weekday. Highly receptive to class feedback/suggestions. Lots of readings, self-studying/experimentation. Hard class, but youll learn a lot about OS, programming, industry, and life! One of the best CS professors at SJSU., Very nice professor that wants you to succeed and ties things to real life application. Very helpful during office hours. The hard part about his class is he wants you to do a lot of the learning by experimenting outside of class. The class is definitely doable but takes a lot of time and self-learning but is fairly applicable in real life., He does not deserve all the negativity I see here. You learn a lot of stuff in his class. Yes, the programming assignments are difficult, but if you go to class they are doable. Also, if you get stuck, he is very helpful in office hours. I think most people giving negative reviews might just be mad about doing poorly. I would take his course again., Professor Reed is a great person. He is always there to support you during his office hours. On the other hand, the class itself is another story. The programming assignments are definitely something you may have never seen before, and the unassigned homework should be graded to help motivate students to perform better in class., hardest professor ever. took this class as i thought other professor kong lee was hard. but this is even harder. very hard assignments (can hardly be completed). midterm very hard. most of class failed midterm. many students even dropped. he doesnt know how to teach. just laughs in whole class., Ben is extremely helpful if you go to his office hour. The class content is hard but youre gonna learn real useful stuff about operating systems., I as well thought Ben would be a good professor; however, this class has made me regret. Ben is a very knowledgeable and nice person; however, he does not have the ability to TEACH it to students. The programming assignments are 100% on your own. No slides to study off of, and he speaks to us in a technical manner as if we already understand., I thought this professor would be a good choice in the beginning because hes new. Was looking forward to his class, but after taking his class for 2 weeks, I realize his HW and tests are insane. His test are hard and nothing related to his lecture. Youre really going to need to study on your own completely if you take this class. Good luck!, Professor Reed is very passionate and talks about things that are relevant in todays tech field. He is happy to help and wants you to suceed. On the flip side his assignments are extremely individual research dependent and even with his provided tools the instructions make the project much more obscure., Ben is new but totally rocked it this semester. He is passionate about what he does and since he is fresh out of industry he has a very good idea of what students need to know before they graduate and makes sure you do. The course content is not difficult as long as you participate in lecture. Definitely go to office hours, they help A LOT., Ben is a really relaxed professor. His class is mostly lecture, for a lot of information is rote memorization. It is expected though. The coding assignments were really fun to do, they include utilities and libraries that were good to know. Only thing is that lectures are just retelling of the textbook. But the textbook is excellent, easy to read., Ben is a nice professor with a lot of experience in the industry. His assignments are sorted and very interesting. With the extra credit, he can be an easy A. The downside is you can get lost at times in his lecture. However, he asks questions during lectures so that helps. He has lots of office hrs as well."
Evan Merz,/professor/1888853,3.0,N/A,3.2,"Very clear lectures. Overall great Prof., If you belong in CS you should have no problem passing this class. If you put some effort into the assignments and study a minimal amount for the exams, you should be able to pull off at least a B.  Tons of us breeze our ways to As in this class. If you cant keep a B in this class you probably wont survive Upper Division CS classes., I honetly think that this teacher has worse reviews than he deserves.  This was overall an easy class but I was kind of lazy so I did cut it really close with an A-.  The homework is pretty easy and straightfoward as are the tests.  Most of the coding tests are open book, open internet, and open homework, making them a breeze., As with any CS course, you need to practice frequently to retain the material covered... and believe me, there is a lot of material to cover. Evan is a great guy with a really neat background. Most problems in this course stem from the CS department itself. If anything, Evan could do a better job managing his time towards the end of the semester., Ill be honest. I took him for 46B and this is where CS because the science of computing. Evan lectures and towards the end of the semiseter became lazy and still require us to know the material. He does give quizzes; a lot at the beginning and then few but it came harder. The structuring of the class is very structure and stuff. He seems legit., While 46A is an intro into Java programming, I believe 46B is meant to separate the wheat from the chaff. Merz has amazingly well thought out lectures. They are very concise and straight to the point. Never once did I experience Merz going off-topic. He is tough but its because he wants to make sure you know your stuff. Excellent but tough teacher, Nice teacher. Will help if you ask.  Make sure you do the labs and HW yourself, lots of  the quizzes are just the previous homework., Merz is a great comp sci teacher. If you show up to class, do homework and labs on time, youll get an A easily. He is one of the most patient teachers as well. People sit in class asking stupid questions yet he is still patient and is very open to help others. Funny guy as well. Anyone who says he is hard is lazy and wants an easy A Switch majors, I had Merz for CS-151 last summer. His lectures were clear  interesting. His industry experience as a programmer gives good perspectives that you dont get from most professors. Tests were very reasonable. Group projects were long  challenging in-class programming tasks were a mad race against the clock. Great instructor would take again., Helpful class. Recommended., Evan Merz is exceptionally friendly.  He is a younger professor so he relates well to students.  His desire to create a great class is sincere and obvious. Granted, he is somewhat inexperienced as a professor so he is still finding his footing. Nonetheless, I enthusiastically recommend him.  He wants students to learn and do well, and we do learn., In class programming tests were extremely unfair. My lab instructor was even surprised how difficult the exams were and he said it took him 4 hours to complete the exam when he tried it himself. All of students were only given 75min. There are some people who have done very well in the class but it is because they have learned the material before., I dont know what these ratings are talking about regarding impossible exams and 12 hour homework. Once I started reading the book, the class got easy. I admit I failed every in-class coding exam, but that was me being a bad student, not Merzs fault. Coding is new to us, many of these bad ratings are because its hard to learn. Its not his fault., Compared to CS46A, this is a real programming class and it will be hard, so take it seriously. I agree that he can be mildly hard to approach, but is generally friendly once you do. You CANNOT do his assignments the night before. Read the book, go to lecture and youll have enough of an idea to get SOME points on coding exams and quizzes., He expects you to know everything you learned in CS46A by heart. His coding assignments and quizzes are not that hard but his exams are just terrible. If you want to pass this class then you better do all your assignments and have B or better in the class before going into the finals., Merz is a good programmer, but not a good teacher. His expectations for second semester programmers seem unreasonably high, and he refused to give additional practice problems or recommend videos when we were struggling with recursion. I thought his in-class coding quizzes/tests were overly challenging and his javadoc hard to understand., Unless you feel like you know more about java than any professor teaching a course in java would, dont take Merz. He claims he is approachable for help, but he is actually very rude and will make you feel useless and stupid., I have programming experience so this was very easy. People saying he teaching is similar to realworld have not worked in the industry I assume. It is NOT like the way he teaches/codes,ask anyone in the industry and they\d laugh how stupid and absurd his code is. From simple things like method naming to logic, the industry does not work this way., Lold at 12 hour assignment, considering it all averages out to about 12-18 lines of code per assignment and use of the basic sorts, recursion, and data structures. Merz happens to be a pretty good teacher whos just starting out, and slightly inexperienced .hes friendly and approachable if you decide to talk to him. willing to help if you want, He takes the joy out of programming with his 12 hour assignments and impossible exams., If you actually like programming and arent only a CS major because you like video games, this class will be easy. expect to spend 1 hour per week on assignments. Exams were straight forward and not overly difficult. My only complaint is that Merz is too tolerant of people talking during lecture., He expects far too much from his students, but does not give them the tools necessary in order for them to succeed. He is very unapproachable and it almost seems as though he takes out his own problems on his students., If you like computer science then you will succeed.  Good professor if you are interested in learning.  He provides relevance to otherwise relatively abstract concepts., Very condescending guy that you wouldnt want to be near. If you arent a great programmer, youll end up not liking him. He made a programming exam very difficult to fully complete within 1 hour and never curved it. So expect to be stressed out in his courses., If you want to stay away of having an 80% risk of failing the class, dont take this professor. His exams are extremely hard. He wants you to do a perfect score in 75 min of exam time which is coding in class and his coding exams are very hard that it will take you about 4 days straight coding if you want to receive full points otherwise it be a 0, This was the worst instructor I have ever had. He is very condecending and useless. He could care less about his students and does his hardest to make sure no one is able to pass. He is very unapproachable and is just shy of forcing you to change your major. Do yourself a favor and stay away."
Vidya Rangasayee,/professor/2039795,2.6,30%,4,"Professor Rangasayee is a wonderful DSA Professor. Though this is her last term at SJSU, I am reviewing her because this class was an eye-opening experience and great prep for future upper division CS classes. She may not be a quick email responder and takes time to grade, but is very nice if you ask for help and cares about your success., I already did my final. Yet the grades for half of my programs are still not in yet. You dont even know where you stand. She also looks very dull as if she hates when students ask her questions. I wont say this was a very challenging class as there was extra credit opportunities but the final was hard. But I would chose a different professor., Grade was made up of coding hw assignments(40%), 2 midterms(15% each), and final(25%). Only assigned 6 hw assignments and gave little feedback. Exams were a nightmare with 0 review and she was very inaccessible for help. Dont expect things to be graded quickly. Exams werent curved at all despite the averages being 56% and 63%. She doesnt care., Very rude when asked questions, not very responsive. Makes questions which are vague and acts surprised when its interpreted in multiple ways. \n\nDoesnt curve grades for midterms or show an accurate representation of your performance at all. You have no idea whats going on until near the end of the term or if you somehow calculate yourself., Homework took many hours to complete, usually at least one coding assignment every week. The lectures were helpful but make sure to set aside a minimum of 10+ hours a week for this class. The midterms were pretty tough. Do not take this class if you want an easy A; take this class if you want to understand the topics and concepts., Her lectures are very helpful and provides many in class examples to explain the topics. The class is do-able, but need to put in the extra time to study. Midterms are pretty tough and theres one hw coding assignment a week that is pretty challenging. Also gives out ec throughout the semester., Grading system was very generous as 50% of it was the homework assignments. Tests were not that difficult. With an extremely stressful semester, this was my favorite class and professor. She gave me the least amount of stress. Show up to class, watch the videos, and youll do good., Previously I was on edge as I heard bad reviews.  This semester it seems, her teaching has gotten much better.  Lots of extra credit, assignments worth 50% of grade, and her lectures are very well planned this semester., Professor Rangasayee knowledgeable of Object Oriented Design, and I learned a lot in her course. Her class is fairly programming heavy so be prepared to write some small applications. Her tests are mostly based on past homework assignments, but there may also be topics specifically from the textbook. Overall a solid choice for CS 151., Vidya struggles to teach the material clearly to the students. She has slides, which barely explains anything, and she talks rather quickly in lecture. She creates diagrams on the whiteboard, but isnt clear of what is going on. We had to self learn alot of the material to do the homework and exams. Homeworks are graded very tough. Get a good group, Awkward lectures. Teacher cannot find connection with students. She is unorganized, confusing. Find solid team for group projects. Be ready to teach yourself everything. Online midterm and final. Grading of the HW is merciless. Be ready that you will be smashed with the final project and the last 2-3 HWs. Try to take it with another professor., Terrible professor. For example, she guided us to do for homework, but grader took points of on that. She is not very responsive if you send an email, and very slow grading. Also, dont trust what she puts on syllabus about grading policy. It is very difficult for you to know what your progress for her class is., She talks in the whole lecture and seldom writes, a disaster for visual learners. She often arrives 10-15 min late for office hr and leave early sometimes She seldom pointed out my mistakes in my hw during office hr, then grader would give me low scores. Class HW avg 80 Tests are too long to be finished. Her exams are online, so many stu cheated., OK professor, Ive had better. Stopped going to class midway because YouTube tutorials teaches me better and I just read the textbook. Oh and she doesnt grade your homeworks or midterm until like a month later so good luck knowing where you stand in the class. Assignments are 60% of the grade, find good group-mates to survive., Very disorganized. She would make mistakes and even lose focus during lecture (students had to correct her). She changed rules for the class many times, which caused confusion. Lecture slides and homework correlate little with exams, use Google to study. She even procrastinated with grading. Class averages were Fs before curves (which were small)., She was quite disorganized, used slides straight from the textbook, and mostly read off of them. Came up with examples on the spot which were hard to understand. Maybe because it was her first semester teaching 146. Despite this, she was very generous with curves and extra credit at the end. She is very approachable and helpful in office hours., Disorganized. Office hours limited, unhelpful and sarcastic. Copied 22 slides +homeworks from different websites. Expects you to already know everything by week 2 of the semester. Know C language. Go to lecture, she parrots the powerpoint back to you and jumps to different topics. Recommended: Youtube+ textbook+group study Good Luck., I didnt like her teaching style, she made lecture very boring and just used the slides from the book. I had a hard time learning in her class and her grader will tear your homework apart. She is very slow when it comes to putting in grades. Dont take her unless its your last option, Lectures arent very organized, not easy to understand/follow, arent interesting or engaging; theyre very plain. Gives you a lot of time to do the homework, so start early or youll regret it!! Her homeworks/projects are not something you can do in just one day. Not very good at teaching new concepts or the material. Good luck teaching yourself., Her assignments are interesting, fun and hard and shes caring and kind. But very unorganized and hard to take a note.  If you like to read a book and study yourself and learn from doing homework then yea take it. But if you want to learn in class and understand the material before starting hw, then not recommended., Prof. Rangasayee is definitely one of the best CS instructors youll meet. She used to work for major companies (Google, Amazon, etc.) and is VERY knowledgeable. Most people in the class complained about assignments not having extensions but she gives you a decent amount of time to complete these assignments (2-3weeks). Would take her class again., One of the best CS professors I have come across. She brought cookies and muffins in some classes because the class was during lunch hours and none of us would participate. Assignments are difficult but interesting. Made me finally get into some real coding action. Not an easy A. Easy to fail though. Name your hw file wrong and embrace the zero., She used to work for Amazon, and she will teach you skills that are useful. Her lectures are boring at times, and you might get lost. Shell tell you whats important and what isnt. Tests are based on notes and the codes she uploads. She gave the class 3 weeks to do a project that had 11 pages of instructions. There are curves and Extra credits."
Alexandra Chakarov,/professor/2709680,4.1,79%,3,"146 is hard conceptually, but she makes you focus more on coding than theory, which made the class easier. Couple of HWs are tedious so get ready to debug for hours. Quizzes are easy and the grading interviews are simple: she asks you to walk her thru how your code runs the problem she shows you. Only negative is that lectures can get confusing., i took her earlier for 46b. Compared to some of the other prof that teach that course, she is a good one. Sweet, caring professor and you can actually learn from the lectures. She does activities every lecture which might be annoying, but it helps learning material a lot. Tests are pretty straight-forward, no curveballs. Take her if you can., Really enjoyed Professor Chakarov for CS146. For me, the concepts and algorithms were broken down and explained well enough for learning for the first time. The visuals on her slides are effective and shes very responsive in and out of class. No exams/tests, just strictly hw, coding quizzes, 2 grading interviews, and a lightning talk at the end., Professor Chakarov was fairly average. She explained concepts during lecture well enough, but I felt like I didnt fully understand those concepts until I applied them on the homework or labs. Theres some opportunities for a bit of extra credit if you do the in-class exercises. Also, she answers literal last minute questions on the class discord, Approachable, speaks clearly in not boring way, records lectures, slides online, syllabus publicly available. Tests and final were not too difficult. Hardest part of course was when we got to linked lists and material after. Take advantage of lab instructors and in class learning assistants., Her lectures provided basically almost everything you need to know. No surprises. Her tests are based off lectures, in class exercises(extra credit opportunity in test category), and short quizzes from labs. She has a discord server and is easily reachable for help. Do HW early. HW is graded VERY thoroughly, so test every possible outcome in code., Awesome lecturer and was very approachable. Homeworks were slightly on the more challenging side; however, because of this, it helped me understand the topics even better. Doing the in-class exercises and participating in-class activities is important as it will help you improve your understanding of certain topics., The topics taught in class seem pretty straightforward and understandable, but then when they show up in the homework/labs, it feels super difficult. These homework assignments will eat up your time, so you definitely need to start them as soon as you can. You honestly learn the most from your labs thanks to the lab instructors., Decent lecturer and good personality, but there are so many mistakes / typos in homework. Most homeworks had at least one mistake, most of which require clarification. Labs are extremely difficult and many times multiple groups couldnt finish in time. Lab grading style changed mid semester., Intelligent + teaches topics well. Grades very generously + has resources like assistants, labs, etc. Assigns 1 hw every 1-2 weeks, but exams are handwritten. Pacing of topics + time spent on each thing is sometimes badly planned. Lecture slides arent always helpful just diagrams + she expects us to code by ourselves with no knowledge. A w/ effort, Professor Chakarov is a good professor overall. Her exams are written and her lectures are helpful. The homework is challenging, but somewhat fun since you are learning something from it. During lectures there are in class exercises that can also help with learning a topic in order to understand it better. Great class., Really nice person and an easy class. But a new professor, so lectures are a bit confusing and she doesnt explain things the best way, slides are clunky and often cant be understood without the lecture. Also she stops for each question. Class is easy, quiz every week is pretty straightforward and labs/hw are for completion. No midterms., Had a hard time paying attention in class. Weekly quizzes in lab out of 10, but she grades fairly. Just review her lecture slides. The final was not too difficult, but a little long. HW assignments have interviews which aren\t too difficult if you know your stuff and did the HW correctly., The professor gave very good feedback and quizzes were fair. Her explanations were good and detailed. The final was a NIGHTMARE, though. I was extremely long and the questions were very different from quizzes. Plus, the test formatting was HORRIBLE. Class was good, but very disappointed on her choice for the final., The difficulty of course was moderate. We had weekly quizzes which were not that easy to score unless you have studied this subject nicely before taking this course. The final exam was subjective, many people ruined it as the exam was subjective and different from weekly quizzes., Quizzes every week, lowest two scores are dropped. Just review her slides before them and you will be fine., Lectures were awesome, especially because of the great animations to help understand each topic. Quizzes were lecture-oriented, so if you miss a class, you wont do well on quiz. But there are a lot of make up quizzes to replace lowest scores. The homework assignments and labs were fun., Takes the time to answer any questions during lecture, lab, or even office hours. Quizzes once a week in every lab, 1 hw assignment every couple weeks, no midterms, and a lab proj you work on every lab. She drops the two lowest quiz scores. If you actually pay attention during lectures and study you should be fine., The best CS professor I have had so far! Takes the time to explain each concept with plenty of details and examples. Definitely recommend to take her!"
Vinh Phat,/professor/88389,2.4,N/A,3.2,"He yelled because you asked a question that he doesnt know the answer. Ask him to help you debug a problem and youll see his reaction. He keep saying he is very smart and he can write program that run the first time with out compile errors or debugging it. He knows nothing about what he replay from books or materials., Very competent and nice instructor. He gave good advises after all these years., This professor has a very strong knowledge in OS especially the UNIX kernel. He cares. One of the best in CS., Well...teachers say there is no stupid question ...THAT\S WRONG FOR HIM.... if you ask a bad question, he\ll yell at you and say it\s stupid in front of class... and if you decide to take his class, dont\ fall for the touching story he tells you right before the evaluation form pass out..., the reason this joke of an instructor hates questions, is that he doesnt know the answer to them. the dumbest person teaching alive! hates teaching since he never succeeded in industry. thats what he really wanted to do starting out.  there should be no place for him in any teaching institution., has great knowledge and gives our good notes . but somehow he hates students asking questions (duh !) .\n a not-so-intellegent question is met with a swift verbal blow . exams are a joke (ever heard of a take home final?) . you wont get your HW graded until the coure is over . dont take it in summer., Very Informative and lot of good stuff to absorb, but unfortunately, you are on your own for the programs.. tip:ask around for past papers! :), This guy and his class were a joke... and not a funny one. I\m glad he\s retired and nobody else needs to be subjected to his teaching., No Comments, ****ING MEANEST PROFESSOR EVER.  DONT ASK HIM QUESTIONS UNLESS U WANT TO BE HUMILIATED.  VERY LAZY, LOSES EXAMS YOU TOOK ALMOST ALL THE TIME.  GRADE FOR CLASS WAS BASED ON 1 FINAL.  DO OR DIE., If you are smart, you will do well in his class.  He will slap down any dumb questions -- so dont ask any., You just have to keep quiet and do the work on your own.  He warms up toward the end.  Very knowlegeable and an extreemly fair grader.  I got a lot from this class., Professor Phat is horrible. He is very pretentious, and lacks grasp on material. Wont let anybody ask questions. If somebody gets a question through, he has been known to answer them incorrectly. Dont bother., He is trying to learn what he is supposed to be teaching, and hes trying hard. He doesnt earn or deserve any respect, but he demands it. Take him if you just want to pass. Avoid him if you want an A or to learn anything., Gives the same lectures for each class.  You will learn from the very hard programming assignments, just not necessarily the subject at hand.  Unlear about course requirements., Will insult you stone-age style for asking questions. Expects you to have known everything that he will be teaching., enthusiastic but does not have a grip on the class esp if you take the class in summer. dont take him in summer for CS 151 if you want to learn anything useful., Easy to pass his class, but he makes the class boring"
Wendy Lee,/professor/2565168,4.7,100%,2.9,"Excellent class with great structure. She is a wonderful person and a great professor, her lectures are clear and easy to follow. She provides lots of resources for us and gave us lots of freedom to do amazing things for the final project. Would happily take more of her classes in the future., Very good teacher, you can definitely get by without going to lectures but be prepared for exams - they are well made and will take every last minute of time., Wendy is nice, but the class is extremely difficult, chat-GPT put her on her alert, and if you do something so optimized, you fear that you will get accused of cheating, so you have to change your solution to something a dumb student would write. \n\nGraded by a few things, minor mistakes will tank your grade and make you depressed., What an amazing lady. Class was at 9am but she would show up and bring us zombies alive. Has an interesting story and is very fair/understanding. If you do all the work you can receive an A in the class, especially given midterm/final are worth 10% each. I will say the class does slightly skip over the statistics you need to fully understand, She gave quizzes around an hour after lecture started to measure participation. You can just ask a friend attending the lecture for the code which is what I did. Thus I never attended. It is pretty easy to fall behind in the class. Make sure to catch up before exams., Prof Lee was really nice, funny, and her lectures were quite engaging. Her final and midterm were only 10% and were quite straightforward. You can tell she likes teaching and is always open to answering your questions. Attendance may not be mandatory but BEWARE she has pop quizzes that are easy but if you miss them it can hurt your grade bad., Uses online custom made tutorials to teach. She helps out and is very responsive. Wants you to really learn., One of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. Gives enthusiastic lectures that are easy to follow. No textbook, most of the material was on her website. The course covered several modern bioinformatics tools and topics, with some cloud computing concepts at the end. Easy CS elective with minimal homework., GOATED TEACHER, a teacher who actually teaches. 1000% would recommend. She sets you up to pass just wait till you see the way she grades, as long as youre actually trying., An interesting CS class, and Wendy did a great job teaching it. You do data analysis/visualization and even some ML towards the end. Hands-ons are straightforward and dont take too long. Midterm/final exams are kinda long but very much doable. Theres a partner project but its not hard at all. Wendy also changed up syllabus a bit to help us :), Not difficult and you get to learn a lot. No reason to not take this class., Great prof! Very caring! Brought donuts and coffee to encourage attendance! Very simple and straightforward hw and exams. Understand the material and youll be fine! Put in the work and easily get an A. Very very caring. Lovely! Very passionate! One of the, if not the best, CS Prof SJSU has. Zoomed online as well as in person to accomodate., Took her for Adv Python. As a Python noob this class was somewhat easy/chill. Her lectures are quite thorough and detailed. Its easy at first but ramps up in difficulty towards the end, so its important you dont fall behind. Other than that, very kind professor and teaches well., I really enjoyed Professor Lees class. Her lectures were interesting and interactive. The class is revolved more around hands-on work rather than exams which didnt weighed that much in class which I found really meaningful. You also learn a lot about many different popular Python libraries that can be applied in future projects., Took this in SP 20 when classes transitioned online. She was very accommodating to help ease the transition. Originally there were 2 midterms and then a final, but the second midterm was changed to a project upon student request. The project itself was pretty tedious, but not bad. 8 homework assignments that were fairly straightforward., A pretty good professor overall. Lecture slides and recordings are posted online. 8 HWs, 10 labs, a midterm, project, and final. The midterm (Lockdown Browser) was on the harder side. The project was certainly doable but there was some confusion in the instructions. The final wasnt too hard and used Codecheck, which was laggy and created issues., Professor Lee is really good imo. She is understanding, helpful, and makes her lectures fun. I learned a lot even with the transition to the pandemic. She uses a lot of real-world examples which is useful. Professor Lee also really breaks down everything to make a complex concept really simple. She got some jokes too. Take her if you can <----, I really enjoyed this class. The course consisted of two midterms and a final. The first midterm was very hard, but she allowed a cheat sheet. The second midterm was a project she created due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a really fun assignment. The final was a free response test (which is much better than multiple choice imo)., Most of the assignments that she gave were good applications of what we were learning in class. She is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and seemed very responsive to student questions. Lectures could have been more engaging but overall enjoyed the class."
Ricky  Chan,/professor/3038081,2.4,46%,1.9,"Pretty easy class with Prof Ricky, and while I do like the group projects I wasnt really a big fan of how we had to sign up for SVIC. I want to build things, not be an entrepreneur. Pretty much all of our DSA learning was David Taylor videos which was kinda meh. The poor ratings below are kinda overblown imo, all things considered we got off ez., This course is not what you expect, its tough but rewarding. Youll learn DSA and essential soft skills, likely work on a group project, and may enter the SVIC competition. Balancing it all is hard, but worth it.\n\nRicky cares deeply about his students. He always made sure to get my AEC testing set for every midterm. Be ready to work hard!, This professor prioritized promoting a startup competition, over teaching DSA. Grading was unclear, often delayed until the last day, leaving no chance for corrections. He responded to students grading concerns unprofessionally, calling students disappointing in emails.\nIf you want to make a start up and not study DSA at all, join this class., He does not teach anything related to data structures at all \nUnfortunately he thinks he is doing something great while his class is not worth a single penny \nEven worse, he is not willing to take any form of polite criticism, Got a free grade but I learned absolutely nothing from this class. Aside from what others have said, sometimes he sent out emails at 11pm the previous night to tell us to attend the next mornings class. He said they were very important but all we did on those mandatory classes was watching David Taylor videos or listening to his SVIC stuff., This class was supposed to teach ds&a, but it quickly devolved into a semester-long convoluted project. Literally has no structure, everything just made up.\n\n Absolutely the funniest professor everif the joke is that this was supposed to be an actual DSA course. Assignments came with no rubric or feedback. If you enjoy guesswork, youll love it., This class was supposed to teach ds&a, but it quickly devolved into a semester-long free-for-all of poorly explained projects. \n\nAbsolutely the funniest professor everif the joke is that this was supposed to be an actual DSA course. Assignments came with no rubric or feedback. If you enjoy guesswork, youll love it here., didnt learn much about DSA, and the grading criteria and rubric were unclear for most assignments. There is a semester long group project which is worth about 20% of grade and replaces final exam. All quizzes are from prof taylor, 2-3 attempts given. we watched prof taylor videos the first half of semester and discussed projects the second half, If you want to learn DSA, this class is not for you. I dont think this professor can teach DSA since every time he would be asked the question about David Taylors videos - there was no clear answer. Dont think you can self study for this class. Taylors videos are great but without explanations and clarifications it will be hard to study DSA, This class was supposed to be DSA, however from the start we were encouraged to do startup projects. Most assignments and workload were mainly focused on the projects, leaving the main concepts of DSA far behind. Unorganized class with unclear expectations, and confusing grading. Main focus project - with no rubric and no feedback all semester., This class failed to meet its objective of teaching DSA, turning into a startup-focused course centered on the professors competition. The lack of structure left students confused and unprepared. Even Taylor was shocked at how poorly it was run. Grading was delayed until last day, causing chaos and unfair stress. Overall, a bad experience., Accommodating and nice prof, but this class was a waste of time. He didnt lecture at all and forced students to enter a competition that HE ran. Easiest grade ever but I learned nothing. Class was incredibly disorganized. Note that other reviews only rate highly because of a free grade, but I guarantee they learned nothing about data structures, I found this professor to be very kind and flexible. Time and time again he would put effort into teaching essential skills that were applicable to life after college, which I greatly appreciate. This class also gave me the opportunity to practice my pitching skills and develop my presentations! Never have I had a class that taught me so much!!, Completely self study class. I dont think the professor knows anything about Data Strucutures of Algorithms since he could never answer the classes questions about the topics. Self studying is kinda hard since the quizzes are from David Taylors class and are super hard., Professor used chatgpt openly to create assignments in front of the class. Did not have a single lecture slide of his own content. All of his content taught is borrowed from David Taylors class. I genuinely believe this professor does not know anything about data structures or algorithms., Ricky Chan is unorganized, relied heavily on videos that were from David Taylor, and did not answer any questions. Professor forced us to sign up and attend an uneunecessary competition (that he runs) for our grade. If asked a question, he would tell you to ask chatGPT or would promote his chatbot (CollegeBot)., Professor Ricky is very nice. There are several programming assignments throughout the semester, several take-home quizzes based on video lectures every week, plus 2 midterm exams. He is good at listening to students ideas and opinions and is very flexible. Based on students opinions, he would like to change his teaching style accordingly., There are quizzes every week,and some project(semester?midterm exams are both multiple-choice questions. The final exam is only a team project. Video is the main learning method in class and Ricky will also listen to everyones opinions and adjust the end time of the project,HW Overall, this course is more inclined to self-study, Only good for easy A. Not good for DSA. Take this if you know you are doing things outside of college that will make you a successful SWE or coder. Very good for self motivated people, who do not need classes to teach them this stuff. College is a scam, and an even worse scam when the professor doesnt teach you and gives you a bad grade., He Does not teach DSA. He is a nice person though and is an easy grader. Take him if you want an easy class, but not for learning., If youre serious about learning DSA, avoid this class. But if youre just after an easy grade, it might work. Youll also have to join the SVIC competition, giving updates every two days. Most of the class is spent watching Dr. Taylors YouTube video and doing his quizzes without guidancetheres no actual teaching., Handful of programming assignments, weekly videos and their corresponding quizzes. Final is a group project to work on throughout the semester and he offers some extra credit. Overall great professor, very understanding with deadlines, cares about students input. Attendance is important, many details talked about in class, not posted on canvas., online canvas take hom quizzs weekly due sunday-are very doable, some are difficult.. there are a lot of them so even if u dont do well its ok. mc tests & gives 50 question practice before & pulls 20 questions out of those(very doable). So far have an A. final: project or exam (u choose). Shows taylor vid in class, doesnt teach himself. Self-study"
Robert Bruce,/professor/2083141,3.1,45%,4.1,"Professor was grading strictly at the start of semester but started boosting grades towards the end. His grading scheme is very difficult. You will need a 93/100 on canvas to get a B+ as he does not have a A+ grade unlike other professors. He is a wonderful teacher, shares lots of experiences and stories. Loved him. Just a very tough grader, He initially tries to intimidate you into working hard for this class but finishing assignmnets isnt too hard if you have decent writing skills. Just use his rubruk and its not too hard to score full points. Most people who dont score well, dont listen to his recommendations or dont read teh rubrik. Dont Plagiarise, use TurnItIn! Big deal!, He is a difficult person to crack. One suggestion is to listen to his feedback. Discuss it with him and he will explain you the mistakes whole heartedly. After the semester ends, you will definitely notice the improvements in yourself., Do NOT take writing class with him. Or he will be your nightmare for a whole semester!, this professor takes a technical writing course which is just a requirement for graduates and behaves as if he teaching a Core subject. He makes sure he treats everybody very very very very critically. He does NOT give a good grade at all. He is a complete self boosting, pessimistic, and unnecessarily hyper professor. Better to NEVER take his cours, DO NOT take CMPE 294 under this prof. His grading is tough and if his class is until 9.00PM he will give in class assignments and make you stay in class until 10-10:30PM. Sometimes even leaves the class and makes you stay and asks to switch the lights off., Semester long group software project that requires working with various C++ Computer Vision libs to implement a face detection pipeline and web application. Chill 25 min group presentation at end of semester. 1 short midterm and final. Learned useful technology, project implementation is open ended but you need C++ knowledge to work with libraries., I would not recommend taking any class under this professor, this professor does not give any chance to students to explain themselves even if the mistake is trivial but still he takes such small things to high level committee. He is rude sometimes.  He is a very difficult person to talk to., Class consisted of short midterm and final, and 5 overarching programming assignments that explore interesting topics. There is a lot of self-learning and reading to do to complete the assignments, but it imparts some valuable knowledge related to computer graphics. Great professor, really made taking computer graphics at SJSU interesting., Hes willing to answer any question you have, but he takes too long to grade assignments. I have no idea if Im gonna pass this class, its really scaring me not knowing how well I did up until now. Sometimes hes unclear, whole class had to redo assignments. He is very picky on requirements., Class was an intro to computer graphics so was very shallow (most topics glossed over instead of teaching implementation). Interesting lectures and 3 programming projects. 3 very short (some 15 question multiple choice) exams  worth a total of 50% of grade (short can be a bad thing if you miss even a few questions). VERY slow grader on projects!"
Genya Ishigaki,/professor/2804449,3.7,67%,3.2,"Genya is a great guy, super accessible outside of class. One of my favorite professors here at SJSU. Make sure you take advantage of his office hours., I have been taking CS272 and absolutely love how the professor has structured the course. Of course, the course is challenging, it is RL and involves a lot of Math intuition. The prof breaks down each concept in class with explanations and coding exercises and then drives home the concept through homeworks. I would 100% recommend his class!, yeah dude, I totally understand. I am also taking his CS 272 Reinforcement Learning class and hate it!\nThere weren\t other classes besides Machine Learning and Graphs and Topics in ML being offered.\nDue to schedule conflicts was forced to take this class. \n\nBro, the concepts are hard but his class setup is not good. Tricky hw/exams/quizzes!, Im taking this dudes master level CS 272 class and honestly wish I had the choice of taking other professors. \nHe purposely tries to trick you on the quizzes and exams. He makes the class way harder than it already is.\n\nI genuinely regret taking his class but I need it for graduation! \nI hate his teaching style and the difficulty of the exam que, This was one of the only classes I took at SJSU that made me feel like I learned knowledge/skills/tools that are actually useful and applicable to the real world. Content covers the fundamentals of navigating unix & data presentation via Google colab. Easy, open-note exams, pretty easy and (most importantly) interesting homework assignments. Great!, Great class, covered most of the Unix / Linux fundamentals. Assignments built confidence and were somewhat difficult but not too much so. Prof. did a great job providing a practical learning experience built around the how of processing big data, if not as much the what. I felt like a Linux master after taking this class., I dont usually write RMP reviews but I figured I would here b/c nobody else has. Class is Unix, you learn the fundamentals of scripting and manipulating files with Unix commands. Decent amount of Git/Github work where h/w is submitted. Hes very knowledgeable & helpful in office hours, knows the material well and will help. Start H/W early., Rating 4 grad class which isnt listed here- his accent is very difficult to understand, his office hours always clashed wid my other course timings, how am i expected to meet? If you are that hyperactive first bench student who asks doubts just for the sake of it, you will get all the good grades, he clearly is biased, had a really tough tym coping, Pretty manageable class. No final, 3 non-cumulative exams total. Taught the material well and you definitely know what to expect for the exams based on in-class examples and hw. 3 hws that are industry applicable. Also curves overall grade."
Qi Zhang,/professor/222459,1.9,0%,3,"Very bad teacher do not take him if there are other choices pls. If there is no choice have a good group so you can help yourselves out, Nice guy, tries to help, but Im paying way too much for my education, He shouldn\t be teaching. He\s not good at teaching at all. He always compares smart students with you. exam/quiz is unfair. Do NOT take him if you want to learn something. He doesn\t know what he\s doing, talks about same stuff over and over., he seems really enthusiastic of teaching and explaininng stuffs. He repairs his note carefully and really try hard to help student landing a good job., He does not know much about the subject, cannot answer questions when students ask., u don\t know what he is doing + he doesn\t know what he is doing.  Limited knowlege and limited english. He always compare u with his proud student. Fortunately, he doesn\t teach at SJSU anymore., Grading students with his own tiny knowledge, not from CS background, is not up-to-date with a lot of new stuff.. only cares about what he sees, doesnt care about the inside since he doesnt understand it, He tries really hard to help his students find a job. The downside is he cant teach. Since he has probably has been working with T.Y Lin a lot, he teaches just like Lin--an 80 year old man."
Chandrasekhar Mukherjee,/professor/2803427,1.0,0%,4.9,"I had a terrible experience with this professor. Tests are super hard, the average midterm score was a 50%. There were no curves for the midterm or final. He grades based on attendance which is against school policy but disguises it as Participation. Doesnt matter if you participate, if you dont show up, youll get points taken away. Stay Away!!!, Awful teaching & awful structure, I dont know how he becomes an instructor at SJSU. \n\nI do know my neighbors cat can do a MUCH BETTER job indeed., This professor always arrives late. He never took track of time so we were very behind on topics. Only gave one assignment and forgot to give the rest which made the final 70%. For the midterm there is no clear structure. All he does is read off of slides that are not his. He is not fit to teach so avoid this professor at all costs., Avoid this professor at all costs, Was frequently late to class throughout the semester. Does not hand out study guides and says refer to the slides for review. There was supposed to be a project and some homework assigned, but due to time management issues, those were ignored and decided the final would be worth 70%+. Will require heavy reading online. Avoid for CMPE 142, This Professor is very random. The structure of the class is ambiguous and may change on short notice. The coursework was not relevant. Very very awful experience. Would not recommend it. Not a single perk."
Bryan Burlingame,/professor/1871955,4.5,75%,2.3,"This professor is passionate. He works at Microsoft and has years of programming experience. The labs are a little tedious since they are switching from C++ to Python but they make the transition feel smooth and he is very understanding. He really helps you understand during his office hours and he is very open to questions and feedback., Bryan works in industry who is also an engaging teacher. He is really in touch with students, cracking jokes and socializing before class. He also does a good job at explaining complex topics during office hours. I went to every single office hour and had a background in C/C++, so make sure you brush up with coding because the workload is 4/5 units, This class is gonna be a STRUGGLE if youve never taken C or C++. Definitely not a 2 unit class, should be 4. I spent at least 20 hrs a week just on hw and lab reports. Class was super unorganized and lab instructors were horrible and did not help students. Bryan is a good guy but hes always occupied with his day job, he doesnt respond to emails., Very good professor. Pay attention to lectures it will help you in lab. Heavy work load. Should be AT LEAST a 3 unit class. My best advice is read the book at least for the first few chapters so that you have the basics mastered or else you will struggle later. On the tests explain your thought process and put as much as you can down., Really a great teacher. He creates a very open and friendly learning environment for you to work in. Hes an extremely kind grader, sometimes even dropping two homework assignments and taking the best of two midterms. Be prepared to actually do your work though. Not showing up to class or lab will put you very far behind., Very smart teacher. Hes working at Microsoft. His teaching style works perfectly with students who dont know anything about programming and want to learn from scratch. Take him!"
Nooshin Tajik,/professor/2305330,2.8,40%,3.2,"I did not think that I could pass the class. She tried hard to keep me motivated. She was caring., Dr. Tajik really put lots of energy in class to create the momentum needed. She was a great and tried to go really deep into the matter. Overall I enjoyed her class., One of the worst professors at SJSU and I mean it. No clarity on what she teaches, very boring and confusing at times. Questions not clarified if asked. Tough grading. Avoid, No a good professor. Light on teaching concepts, very boring. Avoid, Her lectures and slides were very tedious and her teacher is very circular. She never clearly answered questions nor explained things easily. It was as if I had to teach myself things the whole way through and I was not experienced in Java prior to this class at all."
Sanjay Garje,/professor/2339374,2.8,25%,4,"Doesnt respond to mail from students. Guesses student ability through his hunch and reviews them negatively. My overall grade has been reduced because of this course and even though i had put more effort and done good projects., Learned a lot about AWS Technologies!, He only teaches and cares about AWS technologies. If you care and only want to learn about AWS technologies in regards to enterprise software then take his class., Wonderful way of teaching. Assures you know in and out of the topic."
Harmandeep Gill,/professor/2602814,5.0,100%,2.3,"Class was fair. Professor Gill is super nice and willing to help. The class isnt a free A but comes mighty close if you actually listen to his lectures a single time., Great Professor. Really caring and always tried to make sure that his students understood the concepts and application of what he was teaching. Always responsive to emails and happy to help students with questions during class. Overall great lecturer and would definitely take again. Told pretty good jokes too haha, The class was during COVID, so: - he had online lectures recordings -Used Microsoft Whiteboard (and other technology to teach) -Exams are SQL based and similar to the homework -Occasional quizzes are a bit challenging -Powerpoints do not contain answers, just questons -learned a LOT from him (SQLITE3), Hes an amazing person and teacher. Full time at IBM and part-time at SJSU so u see him now and then. His grading is very lenient and class is extremely easy to A. No need for books, just his lectures and slides are enough. Really inspirational, shares interesting and related stories in the industry. Well respected by the whole class, love the guy."
Tanuja Phadke,/professor/2285137,1.7,0%,2,"More than half the lectures were spent on group presentations and demos. Provides no comments or feedback on graded assignments. Not accessible outside class., Not recommended as a graduate course. Wont learn anything in this class. Easy A, Lots of presentations, theoretical course content, no midterm/finals. Can be taken along with 2 heavy courses."
Ethel Tshukudu,/professor/3029157,4.5,100%,2.3,"This isnt the best professor to start learning how to code with. Overall, shes really good, but really nit-picky with your code. For a beginner class, she expects you to create the most optimal leetcode codes possible without explicitly telling you to do so. Grading for homework and quizzes are often too harsh., Professor Tshukudu is an incredible professor who truly cares about her students success. Java isnt easy to learn, but she explains tough topics in a way that makes them click. Her many office hours have been a lifesaver, and her patience and encouragement make all the difference. Shes always there to help, and I feel so supported in her class., She was an excellent lecturer despite some accent. I barely knew Java before, and her lecture slides and participation problems/zybooks helped. I highly recommend this prof if you are taking CS46A. My only issue is that only a part of the midterm/final has problems that I wish we had been given more practice before. Still, shes the best!, CS46A with Prof. Tshukudu is definitely a blast. She is very nice, understanding and sweet. She definitely appreciates people taking initiative in class (answering questions, etc.). Awesome during office hours, has amazing connections and being in her good books can take you far. A lot of homework and practice, but it all helps towards your grade., Pretty caring if you ask questions. She doesnt speak very loudly and have an accent so kinda hard to hear her. Good thing is that her slides are clear and zybook reading helps. Lab is very important as it is mandatory and if you miss 3 youre dropped from course. Gives very good practice sets before exam as they are pretty close the same., she is a very smart professor. she cares about your learning and wants u to succeed. her lectures are a little harder to understand when the concepts get harder later in the semester, but the zybook readings will help a ton. dont worry, be open to participate in her class because it will make ur expereince better"
Nidhi Zare,/professor/2932442,3.3,67%,2.3,"Her lectures consist of slides and example classes, which are easy to understand. However, the material on her exams cover more than what she teaches. They will go more in-depth on topics she only mentions, not teaches. Theres barely any assignments for this class but she takes a long grading them. This class seems easy until she gives out exams., Easy class but lots of learning., Decent professor. Could slow down during lectures, exams and homework arent too difficult. Obviously, she is a new prof so we have to give some leeway. Decent amount of self-studying, but exams and quizzes are very similar to her slides--I have learned a lot so far!"
Ronald Gutman,/professor/2051781,1.0,N/A,4,"This guy is all over the place. I learned the whole course through the online website that is given to us. The website belongs to Stanford and I just watched all the lecture videos there. This professor is all over the place. He asks for clarifications from students whilst he is teaching. I just learned the whole course through online website., Do not take him. He does not teach anything because He does not know anything about Databases. He does not cover all topics from Stanford website. Project is crazy. He did not say specific things about it, but when we present He always complain why you do not do like this, like that."
Alberto Prieto,/professor/2292361,1.0,0%,2,"If you are trying to graduate, dont take his class. He doesnt care about his students at all. We are now done with finals, but we only know 30% of our final grades, the rest is still remain unknown. Exams and hw are ridiculously hard. Good luck asking him for grading your hw, cuz he just wont give a ...., He does not care about students. He has strong accents, so its hard to get what he says. 3 quizzes and 3 assignments. Need to work on a research paper and presentation as well. His exams and quizzes are terrible. His lecture is really boring. If you are not interested in Computer Network management, do not take his class."
Alpha Luk,/professor/2720713,3.5,50%,4,"Challenging exams, but ultimately very fair. Show up to class and pay attention to earn that A., Honestly, not that great. Its fine for introductory but I dont feel like the class sparked any major interest in the field for me. Some of the assignments were interesting and cool in theory but just really poorly executed."
Abhishek Gaikwad,/professor/2822613,5.0,100%,4,"Amazing teacher despite being a student himself. There is a group project towards the end. The exams can be tough but as long as you study and attend lectures, you should be fine. In this class, you dont have to depend on outside sources like a CS YouTube channel for understanding the concept., The professor is good and well-prepared. Grading is lenient. Was able to learn a lot of things related to Object Oriented Design."
Gayathri Namasivayam,/professor/1723087,1.5,N/A,3,She was pretty bad for her 1st year teaching. Lectures were boring and hard to understand at times. Tests were tough and had stuff we barely covered on it. Hws were usually easy but graded harshly. Rarely responded to emails and was useless when asking for help. Maybe with some experience shell get the hang of teaching but she has a ways to go...
Thadeus Aid,/professor/2132850,5.0,N/A,5,Gives you chocolate if he doesnt grade your assignment. Huge plus! Really really great at bribing students.
Saptarshi Sengupta,/professor/2834186,5.0,100%,4,Dr. Sengupta is an exceptional instructor. I learned a lot of practical applications of ML in this class. His expertise in AI also helped me get started on research that I used in my graduate project. I highly recommend his course for breaking into machine learning. The assessments were somewhat challenging but at least everything was open-book.
Sanket Kulkarni,/professor/2985741,1.0,0%,5,"Do not take Sanket Kulkarni. He is a TA, and his inexperience is strikingly apparent. His class is disorganized, instructions are vaguely worded, and test questions are rarely grammatically/semantically correct. He also expects students to know material outside of what he has assigned/lectured. His class is tough, and not because of the material."
Narayan Balasubramanian,/professor/2988718,3.0,50%,2.5,"Professor Balasubramanian took over our CS 146 class (though he only did teach a couple of the lectures).  His lectures were very well done, with fully worked examples which were not just the easiest problem in the textbook.  Really cares, and definitely worth attending lecture for.  Funny professor & engages well with students.  100% recommend., The Professor is new to teaching, and it is apparent. Teaches basics of AWS which can be easily learned online. His teaching style is very monotonous and does not engage the students. Does not talk about cloud from a distributed systems perspective. Rubrics for assignments and exams are not clear and are never posted on canvas. Not a masters class!"

Mike (Ching-seh) Wu,/professor/2285136,4.1,76%,3.3,"There are 8-10 pop quizzes that are easy if you review the material before class. He is not a great lecturer and rushes through the slides when there is no time. However, he is super responsive to emails and is a very caring. Go to his office hours and review the content yourself as he posts all the slides. The average in the class is high., Dr. Wu, go for it. The guy keeps making untrue posts to disparage you. This website is a joke. :-), I would say Prof is a nice teacher. He is under attack by many untrue and offensive posts in a day. I suggest he talk to his lawyer to take some legal actions., Thank you for your suggestion and positive messages., Professor Wu is very competent and knowledgeable professor on his subject area. He is excellent in term of doing his job as a professor. The HWs were difficult. but made us work hard and learn lot of new things. \nOverall, I thought he was a good professor., Excellent teacher, tests are difficult but he is fair in grading. Always willing to help at anytime of the day. Knows his stuff!, He is amazing! I love how knowledgeable he is on the material. His lectures are clear and concise. Ive learned so much just from his slides alone. Plus he is always very helpful outside of the classroom if theres something that I dont quite understand., Professor Wu is really a responsible professor. He was the best teacher I have ever had. I was referred by him and found a job as a software engineer at Amazon., Dr. Wu cares much about his students success and he is very responsive to questions. I recommend his classes., Homework is challenging but very understanding and useful. He explains everything clearly on all HWs. The course is structured well and industry oriented. Dont take his class if you want to fool around and get by., His homework takes as much times as all my other classes combined. Thorough, good teacher though. Each homework has you writing a long, detailed report with screenshots, an explanation, and use-case for each of the functions and classes of your code. Each report is 15-25 pages long. Good luck!, Challenging exams help us to pass technical job interview, frequent pop quizzes help us strengthen concepts and an interesting final database application project to finalize our sql/jsp/Javascript skills needed for future job interviews., By reading through all comments on this thread, I can conclude: good students like him and bad students hate him. I am a good student. Hahahaha, A decent professor and a great course for data science. I love the course contents in big data and ml technologies invented and used by Google. A very informative data science course with a potential job interview opportunity with Google., This is the best teacher Ive had! I didnt use the textbook but you have to go to class and take notes. Very understanding and nice dude. Pop quizzes are easy if you pay attention to his lectures. He replies email super quick and very responsive. Grading is not tough. Easy to get A., Mike is a great professor, but there are some caveats in his teaching. There are pop quizzes, but the difficulty of them is not of concern. Mike grades very leniently, he is the opposite of a harsh grader, he wants everyone to succeed. Sometimes he can give unhelpful answers/remarks over email, but during office hours he is more understanding., WowI sent him emails and asked homework questions at 2:30 AM (it was at 2:30AM) and he replied my questions right away at 2:40AM. He always responds quickly. Amazing Professor., I liked this graduate course very much. The topics were both industry and research oriented and it helped me on data scientist job interviews. I recommend this course to all  if you plan to work as a data scientist or data analyst role. Each homework assignment can be super time consuming and take several days to complete but it will pay you back., One of my best professors ever for all courses I have taken so far at SJSU. He is very knowledgeable and inspiring. I passed a technical interview and found a summer intern job as a database developer because I took his database course. \nA great course and a nice learning experience., extremely harsh professor. He failed me for missing just one quiz, hes really a difficult professor. He grades exams very harshly, allowing little room for partial credit. If a problem is worth 10 points, you might lose 15 based on his criteria. His expectations are unclear, and he seems to expect us to read his mind about what he wants., He is probably the worst professor I have had in my student career. He did not teach us anything besides asking all the students to do presentations on certain topics. He barely provided feedback, so I dont really know why we need him to teach us. I really like the course materials though. I hope this class is taught by someone else, but not him., Dr. Wu had great lectures and taught all the concepts well. Had pop quizzes, which would go over the topics he taught. Had a group project that would help you learn about Web-based application development. Friendly and willing to help as long as you put effort into learning. Provides information about interview questions and how to find a job., Great teacher. Great course. Pushing students to work hard. Very inspirational teacher. Pop quizzes often. Great learning experience from the Web-based Database application development project., unclear grading criteria on assignments and the final group project. Grades very harshly. The content isnt even hard, he just grades so harshly., Wow! Professor Wu. The lectures are hila, Great course and nice Professor. \nThere were tremendous materials of the 4 most popular types NoSQL databases introduced in this course providing us with a comprehensive learning experience through the hands-on exercises and very practical assignments. Be sure to attend each class to take pop quizzes and hands on exercise., Get ready to work! His homework takes as much times as all my other classes combined. Thorough, good teacher though. He will have you learning by the end. Each homework has you writing a long, detailed report with screenshots, an explanation, and use-case for each of the functions and classes of your code. Each report is 15-25 pages long. Good luck, Not the best lecturer, mumbles a lot and rushes through lectures. Too many pop quizzes (once he gave 2 pop quizzes in 1 class). HW is long and is of medium difficulty. Midterm and final were pretty hard. Group project is long so hope for good group members. But hes very responsive to emails and adjusts the class schedule as needed., Mike is an amazing professor who cares about his students. The class is not difficult but homework instructions are vague and can confuse you. Tests are not hard at all. He is very quick to respond to email. Lots of presentations including homeworks and final project. Be sure to show up to class because he does pop quizzes. Pop quizzes are easy., Really good professor. You will have to do a lot of self learning to understand topics. His Has take time and require extensive environment setup so start early. HWs are really informative and helpful. Has pop quizzes in class and make sure to attend all classes., Decent professor. His HWs are often pretty vague so students spam questions. This my 2nd time taking him, IMO his classes are often tough. Youll have to put in a lot of work for an A, especially for 157C and 146. DO NOT fall behind or its a guaranteed F. Other than that, hes generous with extra credit and postponing HW., I remembered Dr. Wu said in the class that he never gave crystalized clearly questions on HWs in case that students post then on Chegg for answers. You have to attend classes for detailed explanations. I would suggest not to skip any classes so that you dont have to fight for points. Topics are very useful for my job interviews., 1. Dr. Wu said that he never give crystalized HW questions in case that students submit it to Chegg for solutions. He also gave some examples too. I would suggest not to miss any classes for full explanations of HWs so that you dont need to fight for points. \n2. CS157C was well organized and very useful and beneficial to my job interviews., 1. Dr. Wu said that he never give crystalized HW questions in case that students submit it to Chegg for solutions. He also gave some examples too. I would suggest not to miss any classes for full explanations of HWs so that you dont need to fight for points. \n2. CS157C was well organized and very useful and beneficial to my job interviews., 1. Very unclear/subjective homework, although its (easy). Be prepared to fight for your points.\n2. Minimal examples or explanations in teaching, just reciting sentences on slides.\n3. Badly structured/shallow course: you will not acquire a deep understanding/intricacies of various databases in his class\nYou may wanna take Prof. Kims class instead, This is course is vast, Professor Wu introduces concepts at a high level so the course involves reading, you need to work hard on the assignments which are long so start early! The course is good for gaining knowledge in data engineering if you put in the work and Professor Wu is a great grader so dont worry about grades! Attendance is mandatory., Very caring professor. Extends deadlines for hw and exams. Written and programming assignments are tough, but they teach and reinforce the topics very well. Gives pop quizzes, access code given during the lecture. Curves the midterms/ final exams. Lecture slides are summaries of the textbook (CLRS). Overall great prof would def take again., He has a lot of experience and you can see that clearly during his class. He tries to focus on the information that will help us in the real world. He is extremely caring about his students. He always asked if we wanted an extension on any of the assignments. Midterm and Finals are straightforward and a big project you work throughout the semester., It was an incredibly informative class. I really enjoyed it and I use the foundational database skills I learned here all the time in group projects and my internship since I took it., The class wasnt the easiest, but I definitely learned a lot from his class. Theres one midterm, one final, and a group project. The homework given to you are very helpful for practice for the exams. I recommend reviewing them often whenever given the chance. The group project will require a demo near the end of the semester., Professor Wu is really a responsible professor. He is by far the best teacher I have ever had., Professor really cares about students performance. Grading is fair and he gives you the second chance to learn from previous mistakes and to improve your final grade. He a nice Professor., Yea not really sure what happened to him in the past few years, but he became a really terrible professor. He grades his exams extremely harshly, you dont have much space on partial credit. If a problem is worth 10 points you can lose 15 point according to his grading criteria. Extremely unclear and expects you to read his mind on what he wants., Professor Wu is very enthusiastic in teaching, and caring about his students. He is a tough professor but very passionate. Take him if you really want to have a job in IT career when graduating. Otherwise, I would recommend you not to take him. He provided tough homework and quizzes that help us concrete the knowledge., Not a fair grader, if you show up in his office hour every day and leave a good impression, you will get A for sure, even though you screwed up your midterm and final, thats not fair for the hard-working students who dont go to office hours. Hes exams are really hard, there is no way to get A, if he doesnt have the impression in you., This Big Data with Machine Learning course was a great experience because I learned new things and tools that help me found an intern. The course material was really useful and Dr. Wus experience with Google project was very inspiring; Furthermore, the practice homework assignments really help strengthen my knowledge and skill in data science., This is a hard class, but hes a good professor., This course was tough and very intensive specially in the summer short term. In less than 6 weeks, we have to build a full functioning database application. Its very time consuming. I would suggest go for regular semester with Professor Wu but not the summer. Hes a nice Professor very helpful outside the class., Each time when the assignment or exam come, he always say those are straightforward. However, at least half of people get C or lower grade on his midterm and final. It only shows how his teaching skill poor rather than how student cant study. All in all, you should avoid taking class with him if you dont want to learn everything online. (2/2), It\s a project heavy class to build a Full Stack Web App Development Using Java (JSP, JDBC, Java Servlets, and Javascript) and Tomcat Web Server. It requires tons of time/effort, in return you got a solid WebApp at the end that you\d be pride of. 4 HW\s took long time + be wary of pop quizzes, but they reappeared in Midterm/Final, so worth it., Tough class (long programming assignments + homeworks + tests) but hes nice and you can try to get some points back by talking to him. Transition to online this semester kind of screwed us all over but he tried to do his best and he just focused on the chapters from the text book (Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition by Cormen). Just work hard, Pros: Really cares for his students, assigns practical homework, & is super accessible/helpful outside of class Cons: Lectures can be difficult to follow; homework can be overwhelming as it is LONG; spends lots of time on irrelevant concepts, leaving no time for important ones. Pro tip: Participate & go to office hours as hes a subjective grader, Dr. Mike is very Knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the subject. He is an EXCELLENT teacher who is always willing to help and response to email quickly. Exams and HW are tough but very useful for my job interview. I am looking forward to taking his CS157A., Professor Wu is the nicest Professor I have ever had. He was extremely helpful outside of the class. Pay attention to key concepts in his lectures and you will do great on exams. HE IS A MUST TAKE PROFESSOR!, Professor Wu is very knowledgeable on the subjects he teaches, but he isnt good at teaching them. He zooms through concepts and assumes that his students have a lot of knowledge on certain subjects, and on a couple of occasions was fairly rude to students who asked about these subjects. He sent out a letter complaining about his poor SOTE reviews., Professor Wu is super patient to his students low questions in the class. It ate up a lot of lecture time and delayed the lecture progress. Overall a great course., Prof Wu seems very enthusiastic about the topic, keep repeating how his class will help people find an internship. However, for this semester we spend 10 MINUTE total to cover Graph+DFS+BFS, which are some of the most important topics for interviews. We also didnt cover RBT, NP problems. Miss almost a month worth of content. PA and HW back to back, His lecture source is too simple. He is looking teaching well, but his lecture is nothing to help. He requires complicated concept. However his hw require complicated skills. His group project is also burden since the projects require frontend and backend system(HTML, REACT, Javascript). so ALWays he makes his students ask him weird questions alot., I cant begin to tell you how amazing Dr. Wu is at his job. Hes the kind of teacher who will set a student up for success and will listen to the students to try to understand what he can do to better help them learn. Hes very flexible with due dates if the class tells him they need more time. Also hes not offended by people negotiating for grades, Exams could be tricky, but had similar questions to homework and lecture. Professor Wu was very responsive over email, and could be reached outside of class. I walked away from this RDBMS course feeling more confident in my knowledge of the subject. Prof. Wu wants his students to succeed, his actions made this clear. Overall a great Professor., Dr. Wu is a wonderful teacher and cares about success of his students. If you are looking to slack off and get by, his classes are not for you. To get a good grade, you genuinely need to work hard and be ready for pop quizzes, pop questions and challenging exams., The database project was the best part of the course. We can choose any programming languages we are comfortable with to implement the web based 3 tiered database application. Its very industry oriented and my first web database-driven product ever. Do a good work. Professor Wu also referred students to Google for internship or job interviews., His semester project is way outside the scope of this class and more fitting for a web-developing course than an intro-DBMS course. Difficult exams, blows through lecture slides that he takes from other universities and doesnt fully explain the concepts. Arbitrary grading criteria (one HW has no partial credit because reasons??). Definitely avoid., Truly cares about his students and by far one of the best professors in CS over my 3 years. His HWs and exams are difficult but very helpful to learn the concepts. He is very knowledgeable with industry experience and is very accessible. I sent him hw questions around 1am and I was surprised that I received reply right away. He is a great teacher., I had CS146 and CS156A from Professor Wu. He is AMAZING! He is my best professor at SJSU. He is always there to answer questions and help. Pop quizzes and exams are tough, but you gain a lot things from it. You will love the team database application project. I put it in my Github for my resume., He is not ready for his lectures with his test and projects yet. His tests and hw projects require much higher level knowledges, but his ppt and lecture sources are ridiculously simple and rough. Every week, pop quiz is provided. Final project : designing website with your team member. Almost 6-7units. His accent is also difficult to understand, Dr. Wu is a good professor, he tries to help students as much as he can (as long as you try as well). His exams are hard if you dont study, programming assignments are hard but you learn a lot from them. Homeworks are lengthy, so start early. Write down whatever he writes on the board, it can be on a quiz or midterm. Pop-Quiz every week, prepare, After CS146 with Professor Wu, I found that I have improved a lot of concepts and skills in data structure and algorithm throughout the semester. In addition, I have also gained more interest in coding after completing his tough assignments. Thus, I believe that I am almost well-prepared for my next coding interview after taking his CS146 class., Easily one of my favorite CS professors. The material itself is difficult and he understand that it is difficult. The programming assignments are very general as long as it fulfills his requirements. The exams and pop quizzes can be very difficult but he tries his best to curve your grade based on the class average. Overall, a very good professor., Really passionate guy. Programming assignments and tests are long and hard, BUT he is generous is giving you ways to make up your grade. This semester he let people redo their mistakes for partial credit for the first midterm, and curved the second and final. Try your best even when it gets hard and ask questions. He wants you to succeed too., Each programming assignment need to write a report. If your report is not good enough he will take lots of points off from the written report for example 50% deducted from your score even your code works fine. Tests are difficult and the pop quizzes almost every week. His attitude is kind only for good students., The class almost done, I will definitely miss him. He is the best professor ever. He is always there for us to help us out. Every time go to his office, and ask him questions, he always explain patiently. He even add extra office hours, and comes to the office often on Friday, or weekends to help us. The hw and projects are well designed., Its hard to understand him and reading textbooks is a must to pass the course. Coding assignments are back to back and very hard if you are not comfortable with to Java and data structure in CS 46A/B. His exams are very long and time consuming. You dont even have time look at his given notes. Pop quizzes once in so beware., Mike Wu is a great teacher. Hes very passionate about teaching and inspiring students to study well for industry jobs. Make sure to attend every lecture and stay on top of coding assignments. He curves and gives extra credits so I found his class easier to pass than other CS146 classes. Also, make sure you learn Java before taking him., I retook CS 146 and did so with his class. He will give you opportunities and chances to show that you understand the material and you get the grade you deserve. I was able to understand this subject better thanks to him and he will go out of his way to help you if you ask. You get an occasional laugh during class as well., This is the only review you ever need: 1- Prof Wu curves your grades and extends deadlines often (got Cs on midterms and final but total grade is B) 2- Tests are very difficult and long. 3-Assignment instructions are horribly unclear, but not hard. 4- Study everydays lecture for the pop quiz (seriously) 5- No laptop in class, I am in his data structure and algorithms class Spring 2019. I love his teaching style, funny, nice, and Knowledgable. One of the greatest professors Ive have taken at SJSU. Really cares about the success of his students. Very understanding and humorous guy. I am really enjoying taking his class., Professor Wu is super considerable and knows the connection between the material in books and the implementation in industry. He is trying to make all the students to catch up, and he spends so many time to help students to improve their performance of this course after class. He is always energetic and passionate during his lectures., Professor Wu is a vey nice professor. He gave interesting programming assignments, lots of assignments, and pop quizzes to make students learn. I recommend Professor Wu to those who want to understand and do well in Data Structures and Algorithms., Professor Wu isnt a very good professor. He cant even pace his own class. Im not sure if it was just our session or if the other sessions had issues too, but he would go extremely slowly at the beginning of the semester, then he would realize he was going to slow and try and speed through everything, not giving enough time to learn the concepts., Terrible attitude in class and out of class. Says that no questions are stupid questions but if you do ask him a question that he thinks is stupid, he will make fun of you in class. Really rude and hard to approach., He is great. I went to his office to ask questions and he was always very nice and clearly answered my questions. He wouldnt mind meet me on Friday or even Saturday because my class schedule conflicted with all his office hours., Dr. Wu is one of the best profs Ive ever had. Hes extensive industry experience and very knowledgeable in the field. After finishing my programming hws, I got so much great concepts of how Google search engine and Facebook work in using data structures and algorithms. I would say that if you dont miss class and ask questions, you should be OK., Gives long homeworks and projects so that there isnt even enough time to prepare for the tests. Doesnt explain concepts clearly in class, so a lot of it will rely on yourself being able to study. Test questions are very long as well, Really bad professor. Says you can email him or go to his office hours but there was a few times I went to his office hours to ask a question or debug my code and he didnt even try to help me at all. His tests are really long too, many people didnt even get to finish the midterms both times., Although Dr. Wu isnt the best lecturer in the word, he is definitely one of the best professors that Ive had so far. He is very knowledgeable and very approachable outside of class and always encourages you to ask him questions if you have any. He is a tough but fair grader. You will learn the concepts very well in his class., Professor Wu is an excellent Computer Science professor. He cares about the success of all of his students, and he tries his best to ensure everyone in his class learns the material. He can be a tough grader, but he is also fair. I would highly recommend him to any student looking to take data structures and algorithms., Professor Wu cares about the learning progress of students and is very responsive to questions. I learned a lot of concept and skills in Big Data from this course. Some of homework assignments are challenge and time consuming, but very useful and practical. I have found an intern job in Silicon Valley. This is a must-take graduate class., Dr. Wu is a really nice guy and cares about his students. He is so much more approachable than the other CS146 teachers, very responsibe email. Hes also flexible with deadlines when students ask for it (big life saver). Of course being 146 its still a challenging class. Very fair grader. Its not mandatory to attend but it helps you stay updated., Great professor and very knowledgable in the topics. I enjoyed his class very much., Dr. Wu struggles with teaching, but hes nice, respected and highly accessible. I love how much he cares about students success and his experience in the field (Google). His tests and assignments are not bad (hard sometimes), but I wish he could bring more coding interview questions to programming assignments. He grades easily, with curve, though., Wu is one of the nicest professors Ive ever had. He respects you as a student, and will go out of his way to help. His lectures are very mediocre, you will need to study to pass this class. The concepts are hard and you cant retain all the material by attending lecture. Wu will RECOMMEND YOU for jobs if you do well in his class and he likes you., Professor Wu is a good teacher. His teaching is kinda meh..... you need to spend time study more by yourself. But he always answers your questions no matter what time you email him. And his test is not that easy, but if you spend time perhaps, its not super hard either. Plus he gave lots of 2nd chances for students to improve if they doing badly on the midterm."
Ty Lin,/professor/18,1.4,25%,3,"Ty Lin seems like a great guy. Love his classes, always looking forward to them , because he is so nice and motivating., Ive never been more confused in all my school years. He is very disorganized. Teaches a topic at the end that is not available online, in textbooks or even through adequate in-class materials. Ive never seen the whole class so confused and disappointed in a teacher. Youve been warned., Not a good choice. Difficult to understand his english. Random lecture topics. Seemed unorganised and chaotic. However you dont have much of a choice with his subject., Database is an important class, so please dont waste yours on him., Adamant, vague, confusing. In the two lectures I stayed for, Lin was very insistent that we all have Visual Studio (even if it meant installing another OS). He threatened to drop anyone who couldnt get it, despite there being more viable alternatives to VS. The advice he gives is questionable; he told me the C# template I had was fine (it wasnt)., Horrible teacher. Barely lectures during class time, and continually talks about his project his students have contributed to over the years. Its nearly impossible to understand what he is saying; he doesnt clarify details at all. Gives sporadic quizzes 5 minutes after an unclear lecture. Probably the worst class Ive taken in my life. AVOID HIM., It is really easy class. If you get lower than B+, then you might need to switch Major. Class topic can be helpful for your study but lecture is NOT useful, Absolutely and unequivocally the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. You will learn very little to nothing from him and what he expects on assignments and tests is unclear. His communication skills, both written and verbal, are almost nonexistent. The class was a very long and stressful way to learn a little SQL from a textbook., Worst professor on earth. Harasses mentally. NOT fair with grading. Calls on weekends, holidays. His moto is to torture students, Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class., Worst professor I have ever had. Horrible lectures and repeats the same lectures over and over. Barely taught anything and never used the book. Tried to defend his poor teaching by showing student evaluations from 10 years ago and then bash the rest of the teachers as SJSU for not publishing as much as him., Dont ever take his subject. He is horrible, he takes tests but never grades them. U dont have to work in his subject and u learn nothing., Bad lecturer. Disorganized. Learned very little about assembly. Stayed on one topic for the entire semester. Keeps poor records of grades., Hes a great programmer but a pretty bad professor. Hes useless unless you can understand what hes trying to say. His teaching style can be described as authoritarian. Look, if you understand him and truly care about the subject, youll learn quite a lot. Otherwise, avoid., Worst professor i have ever seen. i dont understand what is he doing in San Jose State? Waste of time and money. Dont take this class unless you have to. Grades are easy to get, but you wont learn anything. Not a single word ! He doesnt even know what he is teaching. He neither understand nor speak proper English.. Avoid it guys...., Absolutely the worst instructor I have ever had. His lectures are unorganized, unclear, and repetitive. Taking his class was a waste of my time and money. Save yourself the trouble and avoid him at all costs. Lin should not be given the right to retire; he should be fired as soon as possible., The worst teacher. I got an A in the course, so I am not bitter. Previous reviews are true. A third exam a week before the final is proof of his disorganization. Waited until the final day to inform us that only the top 10% (out of 25 students) will receive As regardless of overall %. The head of CS has received many complaints about Lin., He really likes to talk about himself. He lectures about the same thing for a few weeks, which you dont learn anything new in the class. He does not have a set schedule, grading policy, or midterm schedule, so expect to take random quizes and midterms. Not recommended. He knows his stuff, but doesnt know how to lecture., Do not take this teacher. First of all he only speaks about himself most of the class time. Then he spents all other time giving quiz which he didnt teach. No only that, he doesnt give answers to the exams or quizzes if asked in the class. In many occastions he ignores student questions and not answer them throughout the class. He prefers you to, Sloppy, careless, and utterly incomprehensible. Also a hypocrite. Squawks about students not having the right attitude or not putting in enough effort, but puts in zero to no effort into teaching the class! He wore pajama pants under his jeans once. What a lazy professor! His tests and notes look like they were typed by retarded monkeys. AVOID!!!, Dr.ty Lin is the worst professor in the CS department. If only he would retire, since the Department cant fire him.  Please do the school a favor and do not register in any section he teaches.  I wont make that mistake again.  Nothing sucks the life out of a student, like a professor that just doesnt care., Lin is a joke. Not fair grading, doesnt teach a thing. Everything he does is confusing. AVOID if you can., The main reason to avoid this teacher, other than all the true things mentioned by other people, is that you dont have a clear understanding of how to be successful in this class. He changes his requirements on the fly and denies that he specified requirements in earlier classes. It is hard to succeed if you dont know what you need to do., No Comments, He doesnt know**** about this class. His accent  is extremely difficult to understand. His exams r HARD. You will not learn anything from him. U have to work yourself in this class. He is very unclear on his exams. Overall: 4 exams + Final + Project + Quizzes + Homeworks. Extremely BAD Teacher !!! Hes the worst teacher in the CS Dept at SJSU :-(, Very poor teaching and a very bad professor., Hell, at least at least he makes up for his lack of teaching skills by making you learn some most cutting edge comsci stuff... Not just the same old stuff at that, What everyone has said is right, he is a horrible professor.  Very disorganized, huge ego, no lesson plans.  He teaches things on the fly. He doesnt teach things and gives midterms on it(And on the midterm its very unclear). He gives points based on attendence, gives quizzes in which he doesnt look at them. I would recommend to avoid him., DO NOT TAKE, poor instructor, poor preperation for class, learn MUCH more just reading the book, huge ego (is always SURE he is right)  he must be tenure and he needs to retire or just care about teaching.. refund?, One of the only teachers who really cares about his students. Grading is on the overall performance but hard. He curves., terrible waste of time, complete lack of knowledge on subject material, did not bother to make a lesson  plan, covered about first two chapters in the text during the whole semester, had a guest lecturer come in and teach a whole chapter in two days, gave similar midterms 3 times, got answers wrong on one midterm that where right on another. and do, Should retire asap. very forgetful and unorganized, come up with new grading techniques every week, utter chaos and confusion, think 10 times before taking the class., In addition to everything said so far, Dr. Lin makes up his grading system as he goes and does not post anything to his website like he says he will.  Replaced the final with note taking and a research paper and then spends all lecture taking attendance.  This teacher should retire or go into research if thats his interest., This is the first class that I didnt understand what he taught in class. I think he is too old to be a teacher., -Sloppy\n -Unreliable\n -Boring\n -No teaching skills\n -Does not speaks proper english\n -Does not writes proper english (exam hell) \n -Avoid at all cost!, Absolutely the worst prof. Ive had so far. While hes a smart guy and made quite a few contributions to computer science, his teaching skills are non-existent.\n We covered, at most, several weeks of material.  Remember that CS140 is a prerequisite for several REQUIRED courses and you need to know the material taught in CS140 to have a chance there, TAKE HIM AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! has to be the worse teacher period.  even worse then Lee and Obaid combined.  this foo is so ridiculous, he spent 30 minutes in one class period just to defend himself after reading his last semesters evaluations., Prof. Lin is a HORRIBLE teacher! he cannot speak or write english at all, so it is impossible to understand nething he says or writes! His choice in text is even worse so forget about learning from that. He knows alot but cannot teach any of it! Stay away from this teacher at all costs!  You will not learn anything and be frustrated to no end!!!!!!, One of the worst teachers. He seems to know a lot, but he just dont know how to teach it to others. Hes lazy in everyway. Claims to be busy all the time, but he doesnt assign much hw, grade exams himself, or assign projects. Hes not a good teacher, so avoid if possible.  Hope I dont get him again., This guy is the worst. Hard to understand (the accent doesnt help) and unclear assignments (I had no idea what he was asking in any of them) make him guy you do not want to learn from. Avoid at all costs., Huge waste of time. Youd be better off just buying a good book on SQL., He often claims that common sense is not a part of databases.  Unfortunately common sense is a big part of quality teaching, and you wont find it in his teaching methods.  None of them make sense., Smart man. Accent makes understanding him a little difficult, but once you get used to it, its not so bad., Good:  This man is knowledgable in the subject matter.  Hes the president of IEEE SV chapter and has alot of connections.  He has a great project.                                        Bad:  bad accent, kinda sloppy, ugly hand writing, This guy knows absolutely _nothing_ about what he is teaching.  He doesnt understand English.  His assignments are gibberish.  He cant grade.  He doesnt have time for students.  Beware of his presentation of Two-Phase locking--most of it is just WRONG!, He teaches nothing. His way to grade students is unfair. If you speak in class, you will get a good grade. Even if you get a way above average in mid and final, you may not get A. Anyway, he is worst CS teacher I had taken before., A TALKING VERSION of DATE\s BOOK: An Introduction to Database Systems Wants you to learn the BIG ideas. easy class, no need worry about the quiz and midterms, he will keep giving the same questions until everyone knows the answer, today in my last midterm, the fire drill went off 20mins before the end of class. Dr Lin then said: Hand in, I will grade as it is. Students:It\s not fair!. Lin:Yes it is! you all had the same amount of time!     NOW, w, I took his operating system class and he is worst teach ive ever had! The guy is LAZY. He has students prepare lecture notes for him. All homework revolves around creating lecture notes for his future use., You know how youre supposed to learn something before being tested. Well, this teacher tests you first then teaches you after. And his grading, after the second time taking him, it is a mystery., He asks students to write lecture notes for his lecture. Although he doesnt cover any topic, he gives quiz every week., many great assigments but not clear., I learned nothing in his class....so I have to take him again in CS157B... still learning nothing, quiz/exam questions reused over and over again but STILL full of errors; forgetful; mysterious grading system (you think you know, but when grades come out, you realize you dont!!); knowledgeable in the field with no doubt, horrible, pathetic, does not teach anything.. gives random grades... worst professor i have had.. does not remeber what he tells students and then screws up things!, very bad professor.  He didnt teach anything!I wonder why SJSU hired this professor!, You wont learn anything in his class. In addition, he made tons of mistakes on quizzes and midterms, plus you might have to argue to prove that your point is correct., His accent is BAD. Hes been in the US for like 10 years and still cant speak! Dont think he knows much of the material either., Nightmarish. Student teacher taught many of his courses, in fact. Absolutely unclear explanations. Tested same material from 3-8 times depending. Impatient, unhelpful. Class grade averaged 60% (bumped to 80% due to his unique curve at the end., if u want to learn anyting!dont take his class!If u want get good grades and learn by urself, hes the one!, He tests you on complex topics, after giving a poor explanation of them. Then he tests you on the same things 5 or 6 more times. You have to really not be paying attention to not get near perfect scores on later exams., Dont learn much, but keeps you updated with technology and research., any person on earth can teach better than him., cant learn anyting, useless, cant teach, suggest find another job."
Jon Pearce,/professor/243000,3.4,26%,3.8,"Prof Pearce is a very eloquent lecturer, and his assignments and assessments are very relevant to the foundation of the class. However, he expects a lot from his students and doesnt respond to emails on time, and his final exam might take over class time (fair warning). Try to come to his class prepared., Wow where do I even begin. This is straight up the worst professor Ive ever had at SJSU. Please do yourself a favor and ignore all the good reviews here, he might even have made them himself. Super difficult projects/tests, unclear instructions, super harsh grading, very poor communicator, extremely boring lectures and personality, to name a few., Professor Pearce is very knowledgeable and all his lectures are on a website. Instructions are sometimes unclear but overall his class and coding projects are fun. He is also approachable and helpful so going to him for any doubts is highly recommended. There are 6 assignments and tests are just like the assignments., Professor Pearces lectures arent the clearest, but accompanying them with other online resources should be enough to understand. Grades are based on projects and he supplies most of the code. Final was easier than the midterm, but they both shouldnt be too bad as theyre based on the projects done in class. Nice and helpful outside class., Lectures are an absolute drag, much easier to just read the lecture pages on his website.\n\nNo curves and professor doesnt help to code review programs before/after you submit them so its hard to get an A if you make minor mistakes all the time and/or you do poorly on a midterm/final, but passing this class is pretty easy IMO., Jedi is a very hard project for the limited guidance he gives. That being said, this is the perfect class to take if you want to get into Compilers later on. His class will push you to understand interpreters very well, and he knows his stuff. Expect a lot of independent study., Doesnt have very realistic expectations for exams and grades difficult. Talks very fast in lectures and is difficult to learn from., He does not know how to teach, makes everything sound confusing, and does not grade fairly either. Grading is super tough, making it difficult to pass., He is not a very good teacher and his hw is way more harder than what he talks about in class. His grading is hard too and the effort you have to put outside of class is a lot. Avoid if possible., Everything was just bad. Grading criteria is unclear. He teaches the class, but that does not make him become a good teacher. I hope these words explain something. Overall, 1/10, I do not recommend this class., Avoid this class at all costs. Unclear grading criteria, boring lectures, and useless material. Nothing in this class is good., Yea, the new language is hard, but as long as you know what youre doing, all will be well. the midterm is all homework, know what you should, and youll do fine. time goes by quick tho. some hws are a bit tough but office hours should help, -Yes lectures are long ( YT /user/profjpearce/videos), but it helped me to watch the recordings over a few times rather than attending live. -Yes Jedi is difficult (custom built on top of Scala) -Exams are REALLY difficult and due to the weighting, worth a LOT -Recordings def helped w Jedi (being able to see his code) -Answers emailed Qs thoroughly, Professor Pearce is a nice guy, but he didnt do well transitioning online due to COVID-19. His lectures were long and boring, which was hard to deal with online. I feel like I didnt learn anything from his class. Do not take his class if you are not good at teaching yourself the lessons., He doesnt curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution, Throughout my 4 years at SJSU, this class with Professor Pearce wins the award for teaching me the most amount of useless crap. SWE majors, there are much better technical electives you can take that will actually help you land a job in the real world- unlike the useless crap taught here., If you\re looking to waste your time and learn irrelevant knowledge to the industry, this is your guy. If you are a SWE major at SJSU, do not take this professor! Homework is long, he nitpicks grading exam answers, and his material is just outright useless. He teaches you Jedi his own made up language that you will never use in the real world., The professor is awesome. Make sure to pay attention to every detail in class because he will go over most of what to do on assignments and exams, and those things are not easy. Do your best to get help during his office hours., This class really helped improve my coding design thinking. Challenging but you will truly learn a lot as long as you stay engaged! Hes a fair grader -- he does reiterate what he looks for on exams and homework; you just need to keep your ears open and take note of them. Assignments are interesting/fun! Super helpful during OH. Would take again., He is a nice guy, a great lecturer, gives great feedbacks during office hours. He is a tough grader, and I cannot stress how tough he grades on exams. He nitpicks solutions that are not identical to his, and he does not give partial credit. If youre looking to learn, hes the man. If youre looking to pass, try another professor., The difficulty level in this class skyrockets after the first midterm. You will be quickly overwhelmed if you start to slack off in this class when you start getting into the semester project. Midterm was easy, final was extremely difficult., Pretty easy class. Few, but simple assignments and a final project at the end which is also fairly simple. He goes over and does part of the homeworks. Tests are open laptop/notes and consist of 3-4 questions similar to the homework but slightly more difficult. If you found CS151 easy, then youll probably feel the same about this class., Few but important assignments. He goes over the homework in class very often, and would also often give away parts of the solution to the said homework. From the hints, one can often use it as a template and easily complete other parts of the homework. The final three assignments build on top of each other, would give excellent feedback if asked., His class is not for average CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you\re forced to take him, Good Luck!, Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard, Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can., Funny guy, makes lot of star wars jokes but wouldnt take his class again. Exams are too hard and labs are very time consuming.  I wouldnt recommend him, unless you have a friend who took that class before and could provide with you with previous term questions(which most of students in my class had)., This course is good. you will learn many thins about Object Oriented programming out of it. There will a project work and midterm and fnal., He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really wont help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct, His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times., Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit., Hardest grader Ive ever seen. The handful of people who camp out in his office seem to be the only ones with As. No matter how hard you try on the homework, unless you go to his office and get him to review it before submitting you will get an F. He is a good lecturer, but no way I would take him again., He is one of the best teacher at San Jose State University. His notes n lectures are very clear and he is very approachable. U have to work HARD for his assignments n project but you will learn a lot. I love UML diagrams after taking his course.I am really glad I took his subject., Dr. Pear is truly one of best teachers of CS Depart. His lectures are interesting and helpful. I loved UML after taking his class. Midterms and final are not easy, but his grading is very fair., One of the best CS professors at SJSU. Be prepared to do some hard work on the homework assignments. They are challenging but help you learn a lot! Fair tests if you have done hw assignments. If you are engaged you will learn a lot from him!, Hes not easy, but he is fair. the best prof Ive had so far at SJSU for CS. His tests reflect his lectures. The labs are hard as are his tests. If you can do the labs, youll have no problem with the tests. Helps those that want help. Perfect English (not a common trait in SJSU). Overall, Id highly recommend him, but be prepared to do some work., Very harsh grader. There is a good chance you will fall asleep in his class. If you do take his class - attend his exam prep sessions and write down every word - he will tell you exactly what would be on the exam., Extremly strong lecturer and funny person. look http://www.travelblog.org/Bloggers/Dr--Jon/ :), very difficult on exams and programmings. each program builts onto the next. if you cannot do the first one, you are doomed for the rest of the semester. classes can be boring at times., No Comments, Nice guy. Lectures are clear and easy to follow. No text required since its all on website (he dumbs the material down a bit). If you just read his notes & attend lectures, he almost gives the answers away to prog. assigs. These are worth high percentage of class (50%). Grader very lazy and took forever returning stuff, though., No Comments, knows language theory inside out . very systematic and well planned out . hw is challenging but also very interesting - u build a language ! exams are tough but dont kill you . good sense of humor and very helpful . take him if you can ., One of the best teacher in SJSU. You will learn a lot from him. After taking this class, youll have a very strong foundation to start a real life job as a web developer. Hope he will cover PHP in the future., cool guy :), The best teacher Ive ever had. Very clear + very helpful + very reasonable. His CS174 class is the best of the best (easily beat Stanford or UCB).  I knocked out many MS guys and got highly paid job last year with the knowledge I learned from his CS174 class., Great at explaining the subject. Makes the class interesting and straightforward. Grades programs easy, but grades exams hard., Look no further for CS152 . He has a Phd in a related area and knows his stuff inside out . His teaching is super clear not to mention excellent class notes , good help with assignments , patience and friendliness ., His programming assignments are the most difficult part of his class, they take a long time overall so start early! His tests will be based primarily on hints and homework. He also has a cool surfer accent. Riding a wave of functions man!, Ive taken several of his classes and he is easily on of the best professors in CS. Extremely knowledgable and approachable. His lectures are clear and he makes complex subjects easy to learn., Excellent lecturer. Very, very knowledgable., A very cool professor and knows his stuff very well. Everything is clear in his class and I learn a lot. His classes are not easy but as long as you put effort on it, you should get a good grade.  The best teacher in our cs department, Dont take him if you want to learn anything other than UML.  Nice guy, but not challenging., Clear lectures but hard midterm nonetheless. The final however is doable. Whatever it is, this teacher is great and I would recommend him to anyone who doesnt like to purchase an expensive book and read from it., Boring as hell; the people who get As in this class cheat. I know because I sat in the back during the final and saw so much cheating going on., Gives the clearest lectures Ive listened to in my 4 years at San Jose State. Expect to EARN your grade. Not the easiest teacher but you will learn a lot. Probably the coolest teacher on campus., Very cool guy, fun to listen to lectures and teachers material very well.  Programs are very hard though, as are exams.  One of the best teachers on campus., His assignments and tests are hard. But he knows his stuff, and his lectures are super clear. If you put effort into the class you will do well. One of the most helpful classes Ive ever had., Youll definitely become a better programmer after taking his class, but you might have to work hard for it(info for the avg programmer)."
Nadine Ferguson,/professor/2490513,3.4,59%,3.6,"The course is very lecture heavy, and are often monotonous. She doesnt respond or improve upon the class given feedback, and her class grades are often in the 70s and 80s on average for a beginner class. And some of these students have had additional programming experience. I would not recommend., I liked the class structure. I appreciated how quizzes focus on writing programs. Personally, assignments were time consuming, I learned a lot from them. Extra credit opportunities available! Professor Ferguson is helpful through email and weekly office hours. Put in the work, and youll get a solid Python foundation and a good grade., I took CS22A as an elective to learn the basics of Python. Lecture recordings are not posted, so attendance is mandatory. Professor Ferguson does a great job explaining concepts in class and is very considerate toward her students. She may appear strict and intimidating at first, but dont be afraid to reach out. Difficult class, so ask questions!, It is not an ez class but professor Ferguson is very good at explaining the materials. If you have questions, come to her office hours and she could spend even the whole afternoon/morning to explain it to you. But you have to study hard and understand the materials in order to get an A. I will retake her if I need more Python classes., There is only 1 assignment every week. No projects. We only had 1 quiz throughout the entire semester. There is a book for her class, but she provides a free PDF version. She is receptive to feedback and does listen to her students suggestions if reasonable. She is strict about following her structure for coding. I learned a lot in this class., Yes, the course is intended to be an entry level course to get your toes into coding, but I believe she does a lot more than that. She explains concepts very well and is also always easily approachable whether through email or her weekly office hours. I feel prepared to produce python code in the field due to her class structure., Beware of phrasing when critiquing her teaching/HW/tests. She takes them as a personal attack and acts accordingly. Easy A if you swallow your pride and follow all the rules. If youre having a hard time with CS you should take this class because its 90% rules, and 10% computer science., Not only she doesnt teach good, but also her assignments are nothing like those in class. She also grades unfairly. It is lower division class but she managed to make it lik upper class, python has never seemed so difficult. All those comments about other instructor is true, its pointless to hope she can teach. Money wasted on this talentless prof, Im sorry you feel that way. Every assignment is designed to enforce concepts covered in class. Programming examples/helper code is provided for students to use to complete assignments. My grading policy is laid out in detail in the syllabus. 3 unit programming courses require a time commitment of 9 hours of studying and completing assignments., You will learn more about acting in front of a camera than actual programming. Save yourself the headache and wait for other instructors to teach the course. This was supposed to be a beginner python class but was more of a theater class. Ridiculous requirements for homework that are not coding related., Demonstrating solving assignment problems has nothing to do with acting/theater. It is intended to show that students can explain the work they\re submitting for algorithms and programs they create and is a deterrent against submitting someone else\s work. One of the important skills in programming is to be able to explain the code you develop., If it werent for this class being a major requirement, I would never have taken the chance on taking this professor. So many hoops to jump through just to turn in homework of which she doesnt give enough time for especially during these COVID times. If you dont need to take this class immediately in order to graduate, wait another semester!, Students get 5 days to complete assignments in this class. For students who have extraordinary or pandemic-related situations, there are accommodations that can be discussed with the instructor., Dr. Ferguson was very understanding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only did she give extra credit, she let us redo our midterm to improve our grade -- thats unheard of. She goes above & beyond to support students, adjusts the pace of the class to students needs, engages students during class rather than lectures at them. Quality professor., Professor Ferguson is patient and genuinely wants her students to succeed in this class. If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties, she is always willing to help you out. She cares about your work and efforts. But all the exams and tests are proctored by Proctorio, which could cause lots of extra pressures., Just the worst. Save yourself a semester of headaches and heartaches and heed the advice of others before you and dont take her class. The worst university experience is in store for you if you must. Berates and embaresses students in front of others, extremely unforgiving with grades, and inefficient teaching methods., Baseless, blanked accusations are unhelpful for other students, so do your fellow students a favor by giving specifics instead of smearing a professor. Its unfortunate that some students use this platform for venting versus providing meaningful information to help others. My teaching speaks for itself., Please, please do yourself a favor and dont take this class! If you are completely unfamiliar with Python, this is not the course for you. She nitpicks all work and docks points for minor mistakes. Tests and quizzes are proctored only adding to stress and will be flagged for minor issues. Office hours are held before the weeks homework is even out, I wish I would have listened to these reviews. Please do not take her unless you need the class to graduate and there is no one else. She is a nice person and willing to help if you can make it to her inconvenient office hours. Lectures are long. No time for questions. Go over class time. Expect everyone to know python. Do Not Take Her Class!!!!, To clarify any misinformation, no Python knowledge is assumed for this beginner course, demonstrated by the fact that the course starts with basics like installing Python, writing basic one-liner programs, learning what a variable is, etc. The option of scheduling office hours by appointment is available if the set office hours are inconvenient., Im projected to graduate after this term, but this class is putting me at risk of delaying that for another semester. It is the most difficult class I have taken in the whole of my university education. Not because the material is too difficult to understand, but because of the sheer amount of memorization that needs to be executed in perfection, I am sorry you feel that way. My goal is for every student to succeed in learning Python programming skills. The class is designed to be hands-on, applying programming methodology. Students are given helper code for the constructs that are needed to complete their work without any need for memorization. This is an applied computing class., Professor Nadine singles students out and there have been times where she acted unprofessionally. An example: She purposely misspelled a student\s name in an email because the student addressed her as Professor Nadine. She doesn\t allow you to use sources outside her class material, such as google, to look for help because that is cheating., This is a serious & unsubstantiated accusation. When did I act unprofessionally and when did I single out a student? I don\t single out. The common protocol is to address professors by last name. Only 1 current student addressed me by my first name in email & was respectfully asked to address me as Professor Ferguson. Googling code is cheating., do not take her! cant seek online help (considered cheating), wont upload her recorded lectures, assigns hw w/ portions due within an hr after class time, goes over time a LOT, docks points if you dont code to her liking, unapproachable & inconsiderate of anyones time as a student. makes COVID learning so much more stressful for no reason., She was willing to meet outside of class if you needed extra help. However, she is unreasonable when it comes to looking for outside sources for help. She considers that cheating. Her test procedures under COVID were ridiculous and just caused more stress., What was most impressive about Prof. Ferguson was that she really cares about her students success. She is so willing to help her students even after class. Very responsive and extremely patient. Once you take one class with her, you realize that she is experienced and knows the stuff. You will learn a lot about Python., In class shes not really the most helpful (may come across as blunt), but the second you reach out to her personally she is very generous about assignments. Its important to talk to her about any problems you may have, and if you dont know how to do an assignment just go to her during office hours and shell walk you through it., Extremely unfair to students who are trying to be more advanced. I already have experience in programming, but she tried to restrict us from not using anything we learned outside the course. I did well on all works/exams, but she always found a way to take your points off. I only miss 1 attendance, but somehow ended up with B, very funny!, I had no knowledge about coding before this class but it was doable. Labs in class are very helpful to learn Python. Professor Ferguson is really willing to help students. She is very approachable and understanding!, Professor Ferguson is easily approachable and friendly. Her lectures are precise, concise, and detailed. She did a great job of conducting the lectures despite the technicalities involved due to the COVID situation. I would highly recommend her class. Please keep it up., I come from a nontech background, I took Professor Fergusons class to see if I would enjoy programming or not and I must say, I made the right choice by choosing her class. She made sure every student in the class understood the concept and the assignments were helpful in clearing up the concepts even further. I would highly recommend her classes!, Professor Ferguson is not only knowledgeable about Python, but is extremely helpful and understanding as well. Honestly, if you go to class and work hard, she answers all the questions you may have and helps you actually learn the content. I really enjoyed her class! She truly wants the best for her students. If youre trying to learn, take her!, Labs are every class, so attendance is required. Her class is difficult so expect to work hard, but she will go out of her way to set you up for success as long as you communicate with her. She truly cares and wants her students to do their best. My advice for you is to ask her to do examples when she lectures, cuz her slides arent always clear., Professor was really terrible with the transition to the online learning format. Exams are lockdown with webcam and she reviews the environment check harshly. Coding is great and all but she makes me absolutely hate this class and subject. Barely gave any extensions or buffer with the COVID matters per student. Has ton of attitude. dont take her., As a student with 2 years of Python development experience, I took this class just for prerequisites, and her class was completely BAD. Her explanation of how to use Python is difficult for most students to understand. She could not explain what her homework meant, because the introduction was confusing. DO NOT TAKE IF U WANT TO LEARN!, Professor Ferguson cares about the students & wants to make sure they understand Python. She is available outside class for clarification and is open to questions. Overall she wants to help anyone who wants to put in the work. This is a class where you will learn Python & can get a good grade. You just need to do all the work and stay on top of it, Professor Ferguson is a strict teacher you have to put in the work to pass her class. Otherwise she is considerate of the students as she was very understanding of my situation during Covid19. My advice is that you have to at least communicate with her if you have any issues. The class almost is like a coding boot camp., one of the worst professor i ever took. she doesnt clarify. lack of knowledge! not deserve to be computer science student!, It would be helpful to me and to other viewers if you provide an example of an instance where things were not clear to you.  It would also be helpful to be specific about what you base your statement of lack of knowledge on.  It\s easy to bash/smear instructors but it is more effective to talk to them about your issue to be addressed -- and fair!, This is by far one of my worst class experiences at SJSU. The professor is extraordinarily unprofessional in the way she conducts her class. Class work is difficult and she doesnt explain it well. During quarantine, her exam was lockdown with webcam and any noise triggered would mean automatic 0s. The transition from in class to online was bad., No one has received a 0 because of noise triggered flags! Its important to get your facts straight before posting false information.  Give specific examples of conduct that you object to? I think its disrespectful and unprofessional to bash the instructor without any basis/facts. Students who listen and participate have no problem in this class., Professor Ferguson is one of the best professors Ive had. She is warm, welcoming and puts her whole heart into her course. She structures the course to maximize learning through both lecture and hands-on practice. Opportunity for improvement through extra credits. Pay attention to lectures and youd do fine. Wish I could take more classes with her, One of my favorite professors ive had. She is very kind and great at articulating explanations for people who have no code background. As an EE this class made more inclined to better my coding skills outside of class and Im considering taking another CS course thanks to her amazing teaching abilities and patience. Wish she taught data structures, She does her best to accommodate to her students learning styles if you let her know ahead of time. Goes fast during her lectures, due to the limited time she has, but you can request for her to upload the lecture slides onto Canvas after class. Overall, attend all the lectures, ask questions and read the material ahead of time and youll do well., Wonderful professor. I did not have any background knowledge about both programming and biology, and was worried at the beginning. She helps a lot and really cares about her students to be successful. She is very flexible and generous. Attendance is very key to succeed in her class and ask question. She also gave a lot of extra credits., I loved taking CS22A with Professor Ferguson. She really cares about the class and that students really learn the material. She always makes time after class to help students with their questions so take advantage of that! Her classes are fun, and Id 100% recommend this class. Good programming class to non-CS majors. I wish she taught CS22B., Professor Ferguson has been such a tremendous help throughout my time within her class. If you are struggling, please let her know, because she is always willing to provide her students with the necessary tools to succeed. She cares a lot for her students and has stayed late on numerous occasions to make sure that they understand programming., Since there is a lab for almost every class meeting, attendance is important. Thou she is flexible and understanding for students with a valid reason. Very patient and kind. She would stay with students late, voluntarily. Very grateful., Profs section is extremely popular. I almost couldnt get in. Shes willing to take questions and repeats the concept as many times as students want to until the class understands. Though she has both in-class lab and HW that can be overwhelming but its for the benefit of students. i wish shed have the presentation avail online so i can catch up, Shout out to Professor Ferguson! She is an awesome teacher and she really does set you up well I went on to my other classes advanced and the pressure she puts on you makes everything else seem so easy after! She is awesome just do not cheat and work hard and youll pass! SHOUT OUT to Ferguson! I took her for 118, She was fine until she accused a couple of students of cheating in front of the whole class. She also projected one of their exam grades for everyone to see. Pretty sure thats not legal. Shes alright until she doesnt like you and then she gets super defensive and unprofessional. No electronics, labs due same day, keeps you over sometimes., Dr. Ferguson is extremely passionate about her students. She makes herself as available as she can. She will give you all the tools you need to succeed in her class. Her lectures are really good and referred to the book seldomly. Shes extremely fair but also holds you responsible for yourself. She absolutely does not tolerate plagiarism!, This professor is very flexible, goes out of her way to help students learn. Does not tolerate any plagiarism, makes it very clear starting the first day. If you ask for help she is more than willing to help you. Expects students to explain their code/algorithm to make sure they learn programming skills. Class is very organized., -singles out students in front of the whole class -has made her students cry -cuts you off -unprofessional and responds emotionally -no electronics -unresponsive to emails -extremely disorganized -often goes over time but glares at you if you leave when class is over -assignments are due that same day, but, can be flexible if you speak up about"
Philip Heller,/professor/2129477,4.1,77%,2.8,"Pop quizzes that dont count for much of the grade, 2 difficult lecture based tests + 1 group project for final, the group project is 100% if you show effort/energy even if code/content doesnt work. Just dont use your phone in class or type loudly otherwise professor might note you being off topic, Hes very arrogant in general and is very passive-aggressive when talking to him so it made it hard for me to want to ask questions from him. He tells us not to plagiarize his definitions but on exams, the right answer is his exact words. I didnt learn much from both CS or Bio sides of bioinfo and I would never want to take his class ever again., Lectures OK bit wastes lots of time with irrelevant stories. He thinks these stories makes us more interested, but in reality it distracts from focusing on the concepts. Can be rude on email. Not recommended, This man should be a storyteller, not a professor teaching computer science. Spent 65 out of 75 minutes telling some convoluted, confusing story and briefly tying it to a concept before ending class instead of directly teaching it. Rude and not open to questions to clarify whatever story he told that day. Try and take this class with someone else., Dr. Heller made CS concepts really easy to understand. Also, he would sometimes tell stories during lecture to keep us entertained. Homework and lab assignments applied lecture concepts. Exams were fair as long as you actually went to class and did the homework and labs. Really cool guy! Go to his office hours!, Philip Heller was great and inspiring to first-year CS students. Pay attention in lectures as he gives test question hints, and youll do fine if you make an effort to attend SI sessions., The guy is funny nice, but cant teach the concepts. He loves Java, but that is all about it. You cant teach based on your emotions toward Java :) Difficult Exams, Dr. Heller is such a rare find. He really wants to get to know his students and fuel their passions. When I was stuck on homework, all it took was an office visit for that ah-ha! moment. Teaches with lots of metaphor and humor, take him if that style helps you remember. Make the effort to be seen and remembered, and he\ll have your back., He made CS concepts really easy to understand. Also, he would sometimes tell stories during lecture to keep us entertained. Homework and lab assignments applied lecture concepts. Exams were fair as long as you actually went to class and did the homework and labs. Really cool guy! Go to his office hours!, Heller was a solid teacher. Homework assignments and labs are appropriately spaced out and helped me the most with understanding the course material. I slumped a little at the end and got an A- because of that, but if you consistently put in a moderate level of effort you will get an A., Extremely Condescending. Repeatedly makes it difficult to ask questions without getting a lackluster answer at best ( and dodges half the questions asked). Teaching method is almost entirely based on using irrelevant metaphors to help explain simple concepts rather than just going through actual code and explaining difficult material., Throughout the entirety of this semester, Professor Heller has been nothing but great to all of his student. He integrates pop culture references into his lectures to make sure no one is bored and will give us an inspirational speech now and then. He does his best to try and communicate to us and tries to answer as many questions as he can, If youve take Philip Heller, you know what Im talking about. The dude is a legend and hes like the random cool uncle of a family. Lectures had Star Wars references and he really is a good prof. Prepares you well for CS146 and the labs each week. The only caveat is that the green book exams on the tiny arm desks of big lecture halls sucks., I can see that Professor Heller tried to make his material interesting. If you focus on his lecture and review, always ask questions, do whatever you can accept those materials, you will be fine. The tests are really hard. I got 100 on the final because I read all of his lecture notes over 10 times before the test., Heller was ok, but I didnt think we was the best fit for me. The hw was fine, but I think he makes the exams harder than it needs to be. If you are more of a Java program, you should be fine. If you are more of a C++ or other CS programer then make sure you get very familiar with Java. He is a nice guy, but can be hard about his class rules., I am surprised by the high rate. Hes not for everyone. Not recommended., Professor Heller is one of the best professors at SJSU!! Amazing lectures, and assigns homework and labs that actually make sense. Midterms and finals are extremely straightforward, and he covers a lot of whats going to be on the exam in class. Id recommend you to go to classes just because they are engaging, but he posts everything online!, Prof Heller tests what he teaches. He even tells you what he will test on the final in lecture so write it down. His class is very well rounded and structured. He is fair in grading and is open to questions during class, something quite difficult in lecture halls. Stay after class if you want to ask a question though because office hours Is crowded, Had him for CS 46B and Biol 123B, hes great. Dude is magic, you literally dont realize how much youre learning until you look back on it because it feels so easy as youre learning it. Go to lecture and be attentive, you get an A. Simple as that pretty much. Lecture is not mandatory but is really helpful., Easy A. Take him. I didnt show up to class like ever because I was too busy studying for Phys 51. If youre not great at coding, you might need to show up and be engaged. Otherwise, just dont fall behind and youll be A1., Good professor, but did not seem like the best fit to teach a class of Bio and CS majors. He did not explain certain Biological concepts or CS concepts in depth so both students understood well, and his comments to students would sometimes come off as passive aggressive which was discouraging when asking questions. He was a fair grader though., Awesome professor, really inspirational guy that wants you to succeed. If you can take him for 46B you wont regret it. Love his Star Wars references and his lectures are never boring. If youre experienced at Java its an easy class, fairly challenging if youre a novice. Just dont be disrespectful or text in class and youll be good., Heller makes the class very very easy, as long as you show up and do the homework. there is a textbook, but you honestly wont use it. His exams are only on lecture material, so show up and pay attention. Beware that the homework is worth a LOT (40%) of your grade and it is easy to screw up submission, so be careful. Otherwise, very enjoyable class, THE GOAT OF CS AT SJSU, Should attend his lectures, reading his slides is sometimes just not enough. Prepares you well for the midterms and final. Be aware of the trick questions that he gives on his exams. He tells you which questions will be on the exam, write them down. Overall, a great professor., He doesnt take attendance, but if you dont go, youre screwed. If you actually pay attention in class and take some notes (optional, really), youll score an easy A. Also make sure you get 100 on all homework. He boosts the 1st midterm to the avg of (1st+2nd) if the 2nd was better. He can also be really rude so try to stay on his good side., Heller is really good at explaining things to someone in terms of someone who has never seen code. This class is really hard to fail (assuming you get 100%s on all your homeworks and at least 80s on your exams) due to the weighing. Heller is pretty lenient on grading, but if says hell dock you for doing something, he means it. Ovearall, very nice., He is a great professor. Its evident that he is very knowledgable and passionate about what he does. He really cares about his students and is always ready to help. His lectures are pretty entertaining and is always making jokes during class. He teaches concepts well and makes it easy to understand. 10/10 would recommend., His lectures helps us to understand how data structure is used in real-life situations. Amazing!!, One of the most passionate CS lecturers Ive come across. He really makes sure you can get the highest grade possible. Only gripe is that the class is honestly a bit too easy. It doesnt prepare you well for 146 with any professor. So I would recommend self learning on the side. Programming assignments were a joke. But overall hes a real nice guy!, His lectures help me to understand how the programming concepts applies to real-world problems, he makes the learning process very interesting, Lectures are well made and easy to follow. The homework and labs are helpful to learn from and will prepare you really well for the midterms and final. He knows what hes talking about and can answer basically any question thrown at him. Hes a fun teacher and tries to make his course as interesting as possible for the students., Awesome guy. Hes always optimistic about teaching and makes it fun. Really know his stuff. One of my favorite teachers by far., Boring lectures. Read slides., He is a good professor however, I didnt seem to enjoy his class. I didnt like his teaching style because he would show us code but wouldnt show us an problem and work through it with us. The homework is manageable and the exams are okay as long as you pay close attention in class., Best professor Ive ever had. Really wish he taught every single CS course because he was just amazing. Made every topic very clear and understandable. Highly recommend!, Dang this guy is the BOMB. Love his passion, his explanations, his openness. He really wants you to succeed. Curves the first midterm up based on your performance of the second midterm., This dudes pretty legit. You learn a lot of info in his class and he explains it so clearly. Homework also helps for understanding concepts taught in lecture. He was running out of time to cover homework towards the end of the semester, but he covered that info pretty in-depth in lectures. Highly recommend this guy for any CS class he teaches., My favorite professor at SJSU right now. I think it was his first year teaching here, but man he was good at it. Lectures can be a bit long, but the way he presents himself (charisma, confidence, knowledge, humor) and the way he teaches (explanations, assignments, experience) I really admire. He has this character that many professors dont have., Pretty easy compared to other professors. Do you homework and you should be fine because it is worth 35%. The class itself felt pretty easy so I was not really engaged for most of the semester. I got a B and didnt put half as much work as I put in 46A. Make sure to go to lab because most programming questions on tests come from there and homework., I can see Professor Heller already has some fans.. And for good reason. Hes awesome. After a shaky semester for the first Java class, I was skeptical to continue. But, this dude is the beeeeest. I swear, any class he teaches, Ill be there. Watching grass grow 102? Sign me up!, Very responsive to students, passionate about subject, patient with students, knowledgeable beyond programming, gives life/job advice, has a sense of humor, is very respectable/respectful, great at explaining tough concepts, very organized, strict/disciplined but polite/friendly, and overall a great person that actually wants students to succeed, First time teaching the course so it was a bit rough but he is a really nice and reasonable person and will definitely try his best to help you learn. Tests are moderately difficult. My main criticism: he tries to make his examples really relevant and related to the work he does which adds an unnecessary level of complexity for new programmers, This class cover some data structures but not enough., You can learn a lot of bio knowledge in the class. And the professor is very nice."
aaa aaa,/professor/1,2.6,34%,4.4,"I went into their class expecting nothing less from the first professor to ever exist. Very clear lectures and holds fifteen office hours a week. Slides are very polished but suffer from the slight drawback of being written in Middle English. Tests are easier than homework but harder than quizzes, exams, midterms, prison, finals, and homework., b, Is this a RMP easter egg?, Awesome teacher who really cares about making sure that you understand the material. Take him!, Really really great cares a lot about your grades and helping. You make clases so interesting.  One of my favorites classes., A woman gave you worst nightmare. Always writing the content of textbook in the blackboard but not teaching you. Never willing to answer question if you did not understand., This professor has a rotten soul. Tests are hard, not because of the content, but because she will take off major points for minor technicalities, correct answers that are too long, or simply because shes in a bad mood. Impossible to approach for help. Becomes irate at the slightest question. Mean mean woman., very mean professor., if you want an F take this teacher!, Shes really not that bad. Shes hard, but she will prepare you for work in industry. You need to take notes, and study the book. She gives extensive review notes before each exam, so students really have no excuse for getting a bad grade on the test. Shes actually a pretty good teacher. Dont listen to the lazy bums., Extremely HARD Teacher.. TERRIBLE Exams. HARDS Assignments.. Impossible to pass this class with her. She hard to approach. If u ask her a question & if that question happen to be from the prereq class she will drop u from the class. Ppl r scared of asking her questions for that reason. Believe me, Youll NOT pass in her class, Hence DONT TAKE HER., you have to memorize a lot of stuff. if you already know java/materials, you are fine., Make sure you know stuffs from her study guides for midterms n finals and you will be safe. hint: pay particular attention to points in the study guide that she mentions you must understand and those that are in bold fonts. For programs/project, make sure u meet ALL requirements. Lectures are bascially a re-read from lecture notes she posts online., Class is based more on the Java language than OOP. Test questions are extremely specific, so to get a decent test grade, you have to study *everything*.  Luckily she offers a study guide and her notes are online, so the book is mostly supplimental. Programs arent too bad, but shes a hard grader. An unusually high rate of failure for this class., Crazy.. possibly the only class students ever gona fail in SJSU are classes that taught by her. advoid at all cost., Shes not as bad as her reputation might suggest. The lectures are clear and easy to understand. However, shes not easily approachable, and being constantly late is a great way to get on her bad side. The exams are TERRIBLE because every little thing can be on the test, which makes preparation for the test far more stressful than it should be., It is a super easy class if you studied and memorized every word in the book and her lecture notes, otherwise, you are in hell.  Believe me, if you want to learn all the things by yourself, she is good choice, because she will force you to study by your own., Not an easy subject. She promptly returns students email for questions. If you put effort, you will get a good grade. You need to be more prepared with exams., Im not sure if she is human or robotic. She is NOT AT ALL approachable. She doesnt have ANY people skills. If you dont go to class, your grade will be (char)70 = F. Worst teacher I ever took a class with. JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER, In the beginning, you cannot tell if the teacher is good or not. Its after the 2nd hw that she gets ****y. Then the tests come and its memorization of CODE. She wont look at your code to see if its correct. She will yell at you for any question., not bad.. at the beginnin the course stress you out a little but soon obaid changed and a B wont be difficult, an A if you go to class., Very hard and mean teacher. I strognly recommend you not to take her class., Material is presented clearly (though mostly straight from the book).  Other than that I dont really have anything nice to say.  Stay on her good side, and hope you dont screw up.  Exams = memorization., No Comments, Pretty much look forward to hell. Ever heard of the term devil incarnate, well she is exactly that! We in class referred to her as hooch, as in Turner and Hooch! Expect her to fill you with every thing, asking you to memorize it, then only testing 5%., Obaid is a LEGEND in CS dept and everything people say about her is true! Shes very mean and difficult to get along with. Dont ask question unless you want to get insulted. Dont take her class unless you want to commit suicide., No Comments, Hard grader. Doesnt give much partial credit and very picky with programs. Shes not nice and insults you when you ask questions. Makes an easy class harder than it has to be., No Comments, No Comments, Few pass any of her classes. Strong temper, doesnt like people. Selects most pertinent material from many disparate sources, and presents it thouroughlly and concisely. Excellent assignments.  My lowest grade ever., In my many years of education I have met some sorry excuses for teachers and instructors. But I have never had a class be pure hell. The Beast Obaid is the meanest teacher Ive ever had. She takes a relatively simple topic Object Oriented Design and t, She is the WORST EVER! Seriously, she NEVER smiled once! She tried to make a joke once (without smilng of course), and it wasnt even funny! Shes MEAN and not helpful when it comes to learning the material. She also reads straight out of the book., Extremely Tough, Extremely MEAN.  Worst professor Ive had in the entire school.  DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES!, Doesnt address students questions well. Mean responses making students feel dumb., Evil computer science teaching robot who crushes humans for pleasure., i will vote for her if she were to enter the contest  Meanest teacher of the decade . I dont usually want to show up to her class just because i dont want her to remember my face. Horrible woman!!!, Cold COLD woman.  Shes not impossible, but shes to be avoided at all costs!, EVIL WOMAN! Only pass 2 out of 25 students!"
Natasha Bozovic,/professor/94609,2.7,N/A,4,"I retook this class, I had a different professor! I wish all professors were like her, she is by far really smart and very helpful. I took her online class and went to an office appt because i didnt understand anything at all she took the time, and i put the effort to learn what she was trying to teach., She is a really helpful, knowledgeable professor that cares about her students. Midterms are easier then homework, there is no limit on how many times you can retake them. Extra credit on homework and one midterm. Overall,  online class definitively manageable., It was a good class, somewhat hard, but learned a lot. Highly recommended., Hard class. My roommate was taking an inclass section with a different teacher at same time so Ive been able to compare them. Online section is a huge time sink, but a lot easier to pass. You can redo HW and quizzes for a good grade. Tests are hard but with a 100% HW/Quiz grade youve got a huge buffer., I am taking her online class and it is the hardest to pass. study all the time for Ds. She keeps moving the deadline for homework assignments. For written hw the directions ARE NOT clear on how to submit the assignment. DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS. TESTS ARE HARD, Took it online, pretty easy class. Make sure do all the hw. Midterm & final are based on the hw (similar questions)!, Shes got good intentions and cares about her students. Youll learn that through experience and her self-gratifying lectures., She was extremely helpful and considerate about deadlines. Might seem to be an easy class but have to know your stuff before midterm and final. No replicas of homework problems, work on getting the concept to nail the exams. She helps all she can and offers extra credit at the end too!, Dont be afraid to take her online finite class, especially if you know the material already. She was extremely helpful and accommodating, and I managed to pass even though I missed a few assignments. Just make arrangements ahead of time if your home computer is a Mac - she uses Windows software., Online class. She was very helpful, clear. B/c course was online, she extended our hw & quiz dates. On quizzes we were able to redue all of them. I liked her class. I didnt think she was a bad instructor at all..I suggest you do ALL hw & understand material b4 going into midterm and final., I dunno i tried hard in her online course.  I got bad grades on most everything but I think im still getting an A, She makes you work your a** off on homework (for only 20% of the grade) . not very clear in class. gives good notes . office hours arent too helpful .\n hard exams . all in all work hard for a low grade ., a bit hard but take her class if you want to learn and if you are planning to become a programmer, she doesnt teach you AT ALL. Take her only if you want to study 24/7 for this class. You have to study on yur own. Going to class does not help at all. I say take any1 except her., i dont understanding why she didnt get fire by the sjsu yet. i took her class two semesters ago like many students, i failed her class.. not just that, i also lost my pell grant $$ because of that. take her classes if you wanna torture yourself., Take her class if you got enough $$ and time to retake...Try Prof. Ng., Tough class if you dont study. otherwise its fine, some of the quiz and exam questions are straight from the book., Her classes were really challenging, but I liked them. I had both 46B and 146 with her. I chose to take her again for 146 coz even with a C from her you still have learned way more than other 46B/146 students who might have got Bs/As from other profs., This is a very difficult class.  I studied for eight straight hours for a midterm and got a D.  She knows what she is doing but she tends to put the things that were obscurely covered in lecture on the tests so if you have to take her, STUDY ALL OF IT!, I would not do it if I were you, it is a waist of time if you are an average B student, 25% of class quit before the end of semester, she got basically not enough., SHE IS EVIL. If satan spawned a daughter i would had rather taken her as a teacher.  When you ask her questions durring office hours she yells at you and accuses you of attacking her as a teacher. I have never had an F at SJSU before taking her class, She is a nightmare. Dont take her class. She make you feel that you are very stupid because everything supposed to be very easy. She dont know how to teach and she is very rude to ask her question! I never want to see her again!, DONT EVEN THINK about taking her classes. She dont know how to teach. Dont think about asking questions. She will yell at u as if you are the most stupid person on earth. Easy get F, Whoa nellie! Avoid Bozovic because you will have no time to copy her overheads and you will not understand every other word that comes out of her mouth.  I saw no difference between a midterm and a quiz in her class.  TAKE SOMEONE ELSE, even Lee!, I went through the entire semester expecting to retake this class.  I got lucky and had her also for 146 (Dropped).  I failed every quiz and midterm..  Well.. I got a D-/C+ on one midterm.. go figure.  I got a B in the class!  Avoid this one., dont let her ruin your career.. i will never ever take any of her class, even she became the only CS prof in the entire CS dept in SJSU !! unclear lecture, and midterms.. i suppose the finial too.. difficult HW.. plus not helpful outside class too.., she CANT TEACH!!!!! Brags about her daughters in college, but  they didnt have her as a teacher. She SUCKS!, A very difficult course. Dont expect to have enough time to finish her exams. Her quizes are not any shorter. But if you study hard, she will award you with an A., Dont take her! dont know how she grades!even though u have past exams and programs, shes going to make u suffer!, You have to suffer before learning.  She is not helpful at all.  She always wants to kick you out of her office, no matter how many questions you have to ask.  IF YOU ARE THE ONE WHO ALWAYS NEED THE INSTRUCTORS HELP, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS., She yells too much when you ask her a question. She needs to realize that this isnt first grade student she is lecturing. She grades really hard or at least her grader. I dont care but i wont recommend this class. I wish i never took her., hard to understand at times, chicken scratches for overheads, grades hard, A very knowledgable instructor who grades fairly and gives you what you deserve., She will make you work your a$$ off. You will learn more than you thought possible through blood sweat and tears., She sucks, uses the slides too much, and gives extremely long exams, Cant understand a word she says...., Knows her stuff, a bit harsh on the grading."
Paul Sanghera,/professor/89841,2.9,64%,3.4,"Professor Sanghera is the only one among my professors who, even in In-Person class, creates the online Course Forum in Canvas where students discuss concepts, problems, and help each other. He also answers the questions and posts very helpful material there. Easily available to help; before, in, after class, and during office hours, on the Forum.., I love the teaching style of this professor. He first explains concept(s) very clearly with examples, then dives into details, one step at a time. He makes the problems easy by breaking them up into fundamental pieces. You also learn the general methods of approaching, tackling, and solving the problems. Gives good feedback and cares for students., A long time back, I took courses from Dr. Paul Sanghera. I remember him as being very professional yet friendly with and respectful to the students. Beside course material, I also learned from his classes good industry habits: Professionalism, team spirit, code walking, comments your code, importance of deadlines. He connects courses to industry., Dr Sanghera cares about his students, treat them with respect.He gives lot, good, and timely feedback.He only scales grades on curve at the end of course.I loved his courses online forum that created for the class, even when the course was in-person.Any student can ask questions or answer them on the forum; he answer to too.He loves help students, Dr. Sanghera is always available, likes to help students. He explains in class what is not well explained in the book. Gives good feedback. He is friendly and respectful to the students. His quizzes may be tricky, sometime, but if you do your readings, you will do fine. I was lagging behind, he encourage and help me to catch up., Goes out of his way to help the students. I am an international student. He saved me one semester by helping me with the Registrars Office. Very friendly, but wants you to attend classes, do the readings, and do your homework. If you do that, you will do fine in his course. No free lunch. Gives very useful feedback. Dr. Sanghera care for students., As another student here said, I dont get it, all the complains here. All this Professor wants from us: do our part. I attended most classes,did my readings, and made an A. His lecture slides are very detailed. Most Questions in Quizzes, Midterm, and Final were straight from the slides. He gives good and lots of feedback. He care about his students, super, You have to work to earn to the grade is his class.  No free lunch. Dr. Paul Sanghera is very professional and fair his his students. He always like to help students, always available, gives lot of feedback. But he want you to do your share the the work...then you will be ok...and would not feel like bad mouth him like many complainers here..., A lot of people have been giving this professor a hard time and I dont get it. I agree sometimes it is hard to hear and understand what he is saying, but everything (hw, quizzes, exams) is taken almost word for word from the slide decks. If you just read those, its not a hard class., He is hard to understand at times in person, but he does care about his students. He opened a quiz for me just because I missed a class, but I was turning in all of my homework and wanted my grade to accurately show what I have learned. His quizzes and exams are taken straight from the slides, as long as you read those you will be good!, Please dont take him., The guy is ancient, not versed with technology. Check all of the positive reviews, they all have the same grammar mistakes, for all I know he himself made them. The guy seems to have some sort of problem speaking. Hes impossible to understand. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Withdraw if hes your only option! Even if you have to stay an extra semester!, He doesnt speak appropriate English which makes it very challenging to hear and understand. we asked for answers to our quizess and he refuses to give us any feedback.\nHe gave us a very hard midterm and a concept we never learned in class. the average of the midterm was 48 from 84 points. very horrible professor, the worst ever.\nHE IS SO BAD, Self-study class!!, Seems like a really smart guy, but Incomprehensible during lectures. Might have some sort of physical problem that stops him from speaking clearly, so its not his fault., he does not speak english, I have no idea how he was interviewed and accepted when he does not even speak English fluently. There are pop quizzes and also weekly quizzes in class. He does not reveal what questions we got wrong on quizzes so we have no way to learn from our mistakes. His instructions and replies on the discussion seem to be copied and pasted., I want all students to know that the good rating on his name is all fake, he does not speak English at all, you will not understand him, and he has pop quizzes in the first min of the class. he is not a good teacher, I would not take him if I was you., Take this professor AT ALL COSTS. You wont regret it, As others said: No Non-sense Professor. Very kind and helpful, but he want you to do your part of the job too: reading and trying the assignment., I took Computer Network course from Professor Sanghera in late 1990s when he was working on Netscape browser/server; he told us. He was first to include Internet (TCP/IP) into Computer Network course at SJSU. He caring, helpful, gave good feedback, easy to talk to. Self confident, not egoist. He inspired me to join Computer Network industry., Attend class is must. if you not, you will get lost in course. He fill gap in textbook, explain concepts and methods. Do extra things. Easily approachable. I was having personal problem effecting my grade. Instead of me approaching him, he reached out to me, to see if he could help. Very caring.  But make you work. no free lunch. HeThe best., very fair, friendly professional. easily accessible. very helpful. good feedback. course difficult if you dont do home work. very good lectures and slides...send lots of useful announcements in in-person course too. take part in discussion forum., His speech is barely understandable. I am not going to draw any conclusions of what causes it, but I will say that he ignores ALL SIGNS that his students cant understand him. He does not read the chat in Zoom, he refuses requests to turn on Closed Captioning, and ignores all indications of problems. Do NOT take him., Very frustrating teacher.  Extremely unprepared for lectures.  Just photocopied a chapter from the book and copied examples from it onto the board.  Very arbitrary about grading.  Very defensive when questioned.  Unable to explain some homework problems.  Great subject, bad teacher. :/, The worst prof. ever. I regret taking his class. Very unclear, boring and arrogant. You will get no help from him whatsoever. Good luck if you take any class with him. You will need lots of it., Very frustrating professor.  Past the midterm and he hasnt gone over new any material since 46B.  He cant explain anything in terms you can understand.  You are better off reading the book (the book is outdated also though) and learning on your own.  Gives very math driven assignments., He is pretty easy on grading. if you want the grade, take him, if you want to really learn something, take somebody else. Listen well in the class, his quizzes are base of his tests. You dont really have to read the book that much. He is extremely boring, ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzz.....oh is class over...., Youll have to learn a lot of the material on your own. Also, he never responds to your e-mail, so there is no point to ask for help in that manner. Finally, there is almost no point to go class, except for those surprise quizzes., Pop quizes require us to go to class, when all he does is read off his slides. I cant understand a word he says cause of his thick accent, and he bores me to death. He has a pretty long resume in the industry, and it makes me wonder why he is teaching., His lectures mainly consists of reading off the material from his slides. Very unorganized, meaning, teaches network programming and XML parsers before even touching JSP. Discusses hw on Mon, due Wed. Peers drop his class. and CHAIR, plz FIRE, Knowledgeable of the material. Lectures are ok. HWs are hard because he doesnt show you how to do them until after the HW. WTF!, arrogant, unclear on program requirements, two thumbs down"
William Andreopoulos,/professor/2534380,4.1,80%,3.2,"Boring lectures, but he knows his stuff, so pay attention if you can. However, I missed a lot of classes and it was sufficient to just self study the slides. Focus on assignments and youll learn/do well. A partner is allowed on assignments which is super helpful. No curve, but plenty ec opportunity to bump up a grade or two., This professor is beyond l .a. z. y. Has students in his class grade assignments for him, won\t respond to private emails because he claims that communicating online is a covid era thing, there\s a chance of losing points if you ask him to regrade something his graders made a mistake on, mumbles, reads off slides, and is always late to class., Basic shell/data wrangling stuff. HW is relevant and fair difficulty. Open book tests. Entirely online course. Participation quizzes are just 1% of the grade, so you can skip class just fine. Prof realized the grader was very lenient and lowered a few peoples grades after the final. But if you do the assignments properly you should be okay., Operating systems is fundamentally a hard course. With that being said, if you want to be able to learn through projects and assignments, this class is the class for you. Many opportunities to demonstrate mastery of the material through homework assignments, the exams dont weigh as much which is REALLY nice, if youre like me and suck at exams., Tests are 25% C questions that ask you what the program will do and 75% content. He gives plenty of hints of what the answer is, so if you dont know you can infer it. A bit monotone during lectures, but pay attention and you can learn something. Very nice guy whos accessible outside class, but dont ask dumb questions you can find yourself., This guy will respond to literally everyones discord questions at the speed of light but dont ask any dumb questions that you can answer yourself by reading the assignment or looking up yourself. Super caring and respectful and tests are open internet and all MCQ. He can be a bit monotonous during his lectures, but try your best to pay attention., If you wanna earn the big euros for your Mykonos trip, you need to learn C, and who better than the Greek God himself(William A). This dude responds to your questions faster than the new boyfriend your ex has just been with. The hws are a bit difficult but tests are not too complicated., Hes a top g. \nThe course content is good.\nExams are doable.\nLectures tend to be boring sometimes.\nHes pretty transformative, and excited to teach you new technologies: Google Cloud, IBM server, and AWS ML.\nC is not the only language he teaches, he also teaches Greek., Professor Andreopoulos is friendly and approachable for guidance. The class material is informative and well explained. if you understand the examples and concepts presented during lecture, youll do well on homework and exams. Youll learn intro programming in C for linux environment, threading, multiprocessing. It sounds harder than it is., The professor is always available. Very helpful slides and course material! He makes the topic easy to understand. Provides plenty of office hours.  Genuinely Cool Guy!, Good Professor! ALWAYS ALWAYS available for students. If you have some cool ideas, he is the guy to go to. He will help you in every way possible. Easily Accessible!, Hybrid class and zooms recorded so you can rewatch. This class requires you to work ahead as assignments take time to do. You can work with a partner if youd like. Tests arent hard as long as you study and they are materials from the slides. He gives clear explanations and could go over again if you ask. Extended the deadline a few times for HW., Bill is really great at teaching OS. He uses Zoom polling to keep everyone engaged, and the material from the slides is on the midterms and the final. The assignments can be difficult but you can work with a partner, so that makes it easier. Overall, if you are one of those people that works ahead, take his class, you wont regret it., Everything is very fair. Assignments are the most difficult part of class but his late work policy is very generous, and the later ones come with starter code. He mostly reads of the slides with a mundane voice, but the slides are extremely helpful and he will elaborate on questions. Material on the exams are all covered in the lecture slides., Really nice professor, responds on Discord quickly and answers questions in class, can attend the class through zoom or in person, hardest part was the assignments (worth the most), midterm and final seemed easier. Voice tends to be boring, would recommend typing notes in class during lecture to pay attention, Lectures were a little difficult to understand, and he mostly read off of the slides. However, his CS149 Discord server was really useful and he always did his best to assist students even on weekends. Just make sure to actually study (the textbook is pretty useful). Being an active participant in the class Discord gets you EC too., Professor is not able to speak properly, always mumbles and read slides. Did not show how to implement major data structures in Java like BFS, DFS, and others. Unorganized and does not present information in a professional manner. Quicksort trace took half an hour. He is unable to get students to learn due to poor pace. I recommend Attar or Taylor., You can watch his lectures thru zoom and he reads off from his slides but his slides provide good content. His HW requires coding around a concept he taught in class so I found it useful in learning the concepts. HW is not too hard nor too easy, but still challenges you to think. Overall, great professor. Would recommend to visit his office hours., Best 149 prof! Decent lectures that can get a bit boring but iClickers help. In-person class but you can attend over Zoom which most ppl did. Worksheets on intro to C and command line practice due every week and more challenging programming assignments due every 2 weeks. Fairly easy multiple choice exams that use Lockdown Browser w/ Webcam., Bill is one of the chillest professors Ive taken, highly recommend his class! Class was in-person but he would always record lectures so we can watch it from home without going to class. Extends many assignments and late work is barely penalized. Assignments not hard or easy, good difficulty. Tests are easy and multiple choice. Very caring guy!, Really great professor! He is always willing to answer questions, and I like how uses iclicker questions during lecture to check your knowledge in real time. He lets you form a group for a lot of work, so do that! Made a hard class that was hard really easy for me. Would definitely take again., I took Professor Bills class online due to COVID. He answers your questions right away and gives good feedback if you ask. The only problems I had with this class were that it was boring and I would zone out a lot because the professor would just read straight from the slides., He is a decent professor, his homework and exams were reasonable, and the iClicker questions (Zybook questions) helped summarize concepts. I think reading the textbook helped the most for the exams, which were mostly multiple choice questions. Easy to pass if you read the textbook and go over lectures., Will is a great guy. He could do a tad bit better on explaining concepts; however, hes decent as a professor. His voice is somewhat monotone and he takes a lot of these drastic pauses throughout lecture but I dont blame him for it., Fair warning, he speaks a bit slowly and can lowkey put you to sleep during lecture with the way he talks. He gives extra credit in the form of code reviews (people presenting their hw code). The online exams (COVID) werent that difficult. He will take the time to understand how his students think through problems and try to help them if they fail, His assignments & worksheets were similar to coding interviews. I know a couple of other students who got similar problem in the coding interview as he put on the assignments. Thus they could pass the coding interview in a breeze!... Assignments have clear grading criteria. Its possible to get a very good grade, as long as you do the work........., One of the best CS professors at SJSU and a really easy-going guy. His midterms and final are way easier comparing to his assignment given. If you spend enough time in his course, you can get a really good grade. 1% extra credit for your course grade if you are willing to do a code review each time. Assignments can be hard but doable., Hes a pretty good operating systems professor, however I felt like I had to a lot of self-studying to do the homework. Lectures were not too useful for assignments, however he does take late work which makes up for the discrepancies of the lectures. Overall lectures are bare minimum, a lot of self-studying which is ok., Great professor and passionate about the subject! Lectures can be a bit boring, but the implementation of iClicker questions keeps the class engaging. Very responsive and helpful via email. tests and C projects are not too difficult. The textbook (OSTEP) is also one of the most engaging and entertaining cs textbooks I have ever read., I took him for 146 too and I liked his class a lot. 149 is online midterms and finals. His questions are fair and exactly what he posts in his lectures. He is really helpful in office hours and gives extra credit. His lectures are a bit boring but he does try to make it more interesting also uses iclicker for attendance., Nice teacher, but lectures are almost useless. 90% of my learning came on my own time. A huge chunk of grade is from final (40%) which really makes the other assignments/midterms seem minuscule and puts a ton of pressure on final exam., Would go off topic during lecture and you really need to study outside of class if you want to pass. Took as an alternative to Patra but at least you know what to expect in Patras class. I had no clue what was happening most of the time., Great teacher in class, however most of the learning comes outside the class. Weight was 20% per 2 midterms, 20% homework, 40% final., Prof Bill is an easy grader and cares a lot about his students. If youre stuck and reach out to him, he will help you asap. The prob is, as this course is the most imp course in regards to interviews. I wouldnt really recommend him, most of the learning is done outside of the class. Take it if you want to pass, dont if you want to excel at CS."
Tahereh Arabghalizi,/professor/2926378,1.8,22%,4,"Harsh grader and cant explain anything. Horrible. Take with others. Avoid avoid avoid, Everyone did so poorly for midterm and final with no curve a 50 average for the class is so bad i cant believe it was not curved, mean for midterm was 48 and mean for final was 42. got a 83 on final grade went to 89 but extra credit and curve pushed it up to 97. lots of hw which is useless bc class was mostly stats with no actual python., Midterm average was 48, and final was 42. Tested on stats rather than python; midterm was identical to study guide and had fill in the blank codes. Pretty nice with questions. Every class was a lecture on a stats concept, barely touches on python concepts covered in Zybook. An A is doable w/o extracredit; didnt gain confidence with python., Didnt have an A until the very end when she applied an curve. Zybook heavy class. Mean for midterm was 56/100, and 53/100 for final. This class is way more heavy on statistics than python (hyp test, anova test, t test). Python portion is just doing statistical tests., Average on the midterm was 56 and 51 for the final. Assigns hw due either the day of the lecture or the day after. She assigns Zybooks which consists of like 400 questions per week which include concepts that weren\t even related to class. Exams are made trickier than the actual hw + lectures and are locked so u cant use it to help u., The professor does not teach at all, the Zybooks have to do nothing with the lecture. Often she assigns so much homework that we dont even use any of that knowledge anywhere, Absolutely disgusting how this class was conducted, changed grading criteria last week of the class and my grade dropped more than 4%. Joke of a class learned more statistics than python. Homework has absolutely nothing to do with in class lectures. Do not take., Horrible professor who can barely teach anything. You wont learn anything in her class, data science major and Im completely new to the world of coding. She doesnt make things easy. No personality, everything is so boring and she only reads off slides and doesnt elaborate on anything. Long homework assignments due on weekend. Overall, doesnt help learn the content of python at all. Got 72/100 on midterm, mean was 54, median was 60, dont take this class. Even if it is a weeder class, it does a horrible job of actually covering python concepts you need to know. Tahereh is only here to do research for the university or collect pay checks, her lectures are boring af and she obviously dosent have any passion for teaching. horrible experience for a freshman, Feels like a weeder class. Lectures are very long and boring; I slept through half of them. You can teach yourself the hour of lecture content in the ~20 minutes she gives at the end of class to do the hands-on assignment. We learn mostly stats in class but the homework is just python coding and its sometimes not even related to what we use., The lectures arent very engaging and come across as if shes tired of teaching. Doesnt seem she has any passion for teaching. Lectures are quite dull. Avoid if you can. You wont learn anything, Not that great. Do not recommend. She is caring and easy grader though., its more of a statistics class than a python class. lectures are all on slides and she just reads off of them. lots of homework and some of them are incredibly long (longest was 400+ questions) and sometimes it doesnt really matter to class. very helpful if you have a question though. midterm was exactly like the review., Lectures are not particularly engaging and she seems like shes tired of teaching, but they are effective in getting the material across and the homework is structured such that you will succeed on exams if you do it. Its clear that she wants everyone to pass, but again the lectures are really boring., I took her for 146 and 157A, she is a knowledgeable professor with clear lectures. Everything you need is on her slides. The workload is usually very short (30 min/week thats easy-med difficulty), however, the only downside of her class are the exams (med-hard). I attended lectures, prepared well, but I was humbled by the exams in both classes., assigned 7 hours of homework right before the midterm, I know python pretty good, couldnt follow along with her lectures.  54/100 average score on midterm, teached numpy,pandas,seaborn before loops. middle eastern accent (mild inconvenience). learned more statistics in this class than python or AP Stats. Class is huge, TAs were picky. dont. take., Failed more than half the class on the midterm., If there are 14,00,605 scenarios of you taking this class, there is 1 scenario where you end up liking this professor. While you are doing 7 hours of Zybooks over a few days you will feel your brain rotting inside. Ridiculous amount of statistics for a Python class but if you are a Data Science major its important. Take any other professor., I am terrible at coding and had never tried-- do NOT take this class if you are in the same position. Her lectures move fast and are very complicated. Tough class even for CS majors. If its not required, dont take her. If it is, just pay attention and keep up with her homework. And pray., This is a intro to python class but it feels like a statistics class. All we learn about is distributions, z-scores, and other variables that are related to stats. We hardly learn new python code. Assigns way to much hw to be done in a few days. Hw is even related to class at times. Lectures are boring and she doest provide depth to her lectures., worst teacher. If youre a data science major and shes the only prof available just go take it at the local community college... Im so serious, This is the most god awful class I am apart of. Midterms are coming up and nobody in class has any idea what is going on. She just reads the slides off the screen during the lecture in a monotone voice and does not provide any insight to her slides. She assigns 400 question homeworks  Homework is sometimes not even related to class., Do NOT take 22a with her, especially if you have never coded before. She will say this class is for new programmers but her lectures are horrible, lots of homework (sometimes irrelevant), and many statistics topics she will not explain enough at all. Lectures are also very dull and she doesnt even cover the curriculum in an intuitive order., 1) Tahehreh doesnt teach in class, she reads from a presentation. All real learning is done from homework. Quiz questions are vaguely worded sometimes.\n2) She gives too much homework after every class. \n3) One time she didnt stop the people leaving before taking the attendance. \n4) The exam was in-person, on lockdown browser, with the webcam on., Absolutely terrible. Firstly, this isn\t even a programming class. Its a math class according to Tahereh.\nShe doesn\t explain properly in class, only reads off slides. \nCan\t redo hands-on assignments if you make a mistake. (Why? They\re not test so just allow us to redo it). \nShe gave a 400 point assignment during the midterms week., Tahereh is alright. Most of their lectures are just her reading off the slides and its easy to dose off. The homework and project werent necessarily hard but its more self-learning than an official class. The final isnt as representative of the course content as it should be. If you cant learn outside of lecture, dont do it., Pretty good professor ngl, her slides sometimes covers alot of math and then sometimes not but shes very knowledgable on what she teaches, a little monotone but honestly better than a majority of the professors here so def a refresher., New PhD prof teaching CS. Offers helpful homework and quizzes for grade buffering, unlike others. Exams easy with lecture attendance and homework completion. Four programming tasks, concept-heavy course. Optional but useful textbook reading. Highly values office hours; gain back missed points on exam and programming assignments. Fair and engaging., First time prof, needs to practice lecturing, especially for first class section (monotone/boring). Rushes and squeezes too much material for certain lectures, but ends other lectures early because there is little material. Sometimes doesnt answer questions well. Only posts materials/assignments after the last class section. Weird due dates., I found it hard to follow the lectures, but the class isnt too bad. Midterm and final (non cumulative) were similar to the slides and hw assignments. Some had vague instructions. Gave extra credit for the final. Responded to me within a day. Midterm was heavy on theory but final was more about tracing algorithms. Recommend if you can self study., Professor Tahereh is a knowledgeable instructor who has a deep understanding of the subject matter. She is approachable and always willing to help students. Her lectures are well-structured and engaging, and she provide clear explanations of complex concepts. She is also responsive to emails and provides detailed feedback on assignments."
Melody Moh,/professor/355668,3.2,0%,3.2,"Put the computer science department down at SJSU. Very apathetic. Dont take her class. Dont explain well. We need a different department chair., Most Unprofessional staff ever in my life, doesn;t respond to emails, doesnt have any accountability, no responsibility, should be suspended for unprofessionalism, WHy are you the head of the department when you dont even reply to a single email? You were never available to any of us, I think it is high time you should resign for groos negligence, indifference, Such a shame I have to write things like irresponsible about you, i am just a student and even i cant tolerate your carelessness. Pathetic attitude, Interesting class and team project is really helpful to learn class subject., Ive taken CS158a/b & an elect. with Prof Moh. All required proj work along with textbook study. Lots of work, but its not difficult and the resulting knowledge is more valuable than reading a text.Prof Moh is very approachable & devotes a lot of time towards office hours-instead of grading papers with her office door locked.Inspiring&Supportive!, she is excellent in the field of networking. she is an angle., Had to take her again for networking, and she is just as lazy as before. We got some work back between 1 - 2 months after turning it in, but did not see the rest ever again. She will try to teach, and does know alot about networking, but ruins it by being very unclear and unorganized., Recommend for networking. Has a hard time explaining topics although she has a great deal of knowledge. Exams can be difficult, but are doable. If you have a good group, projects/homework/quizes increase grade. \n Very approachable and shows concern for the students. My main complaint is that she is lazy + takes too long to return papers and grades., Lots of work in the first week, but thats good so you get to drop before the drop date instead of after the first midterm which is always AFTER the drop date. Otherwise, if you can handle the first week, you will learn alot & dont worry, it eases up after the first week, but still lots of work load. Nice person, helpful, curves big time., Be prepared to do lots and lots of hardwork.This class has got three programming projects,two midterms,one final and quizzes&Homeworks spread out over the entire semester.One good thing about all this you get to learn the subject very well.Grading is very fair and she curves.Would i like to take 158B from her,absolutely., She is very knowledgable, but her teaching style just plain sucks. Learn mostly from the book and her exams are fairly hard. However she grades easy because she has a huge curve. She works and pushes us so much that at times, we just want to quit. Worked us harder than CS100W in my eyes., She has made me love the subject. I find her to be one of the most knowledgable teachers in the CS department and she really makes you learn all the important details in networking. Out of all the CS teachers Ive taken she is the best., What she teaches in class is clear, but her tests are way too hard. You can answer everything right and still get a C. Time moves quickly in this class, shes interesting., Very helpful~ Makes sure the class get 1/3 As, Bs, and Cs at the end, Very organized and provides lots of help with programs!, Kind and Compassionate Teacher.  The Projects will save your grade.  Has A LOT of good information.  Tests are retarted, you can never be sure what will apear on the test which is a problem because she only will ask 3 or 4 multi-part questions., Hate to say it because she is one of the nicest people ever, but her teaching style is ineffective. Tests and quizzes graded arbitrarily, tests on details instead of important concepts, class lectures often irrelevent. Same amount learned as self-reading., Extremely knowledgeable, you need to work VERY hard in this class, it is very tough, most suited if you are going to do research in this area.  If you are willing to learn she is the best teacher in the CS department, and one of the best in Networking"
Anna Shaverdian,/professor/2036421,3.8,67%,2.3,"Thank you Professor Shaverdian for being one of the only instructors that actually cares about your students. Amazing class, wasnt easy but I learned a ton. 100% recommend and would take again., Annas exams are hard and she does give constant homework but this class really helped me on my interviews.  After taking this class I got a job offer. She cares and knows most everyones names. Theres like 60 people in the class which says a lot., I learned nothing during her lectures. Only learned by doing the homework and studying on my own. You can answer exam question correctly and shell mark it down because it was not her answer. You can skip class but then shell complain about you not coming to class. She has to give extra credit just so that you even have interest to come to class., Shes a very engaging professor. She made a boring subject interesting. The class was a large lecture hall but it felt smaller. She is always really open to answering questions.  I think it was her first time teaching the class., I like Professor Shaverdian -- shes nice, approachable, & has an entertaining personality. Unfortunately, shes not great instructor. She reads directly from the slides & has difficulty answering students more challenging questions. She even agreed with a wrong answer given by another student. That said, it was almost impossible to not get an A., She just READS a PPT which is made by Professor Stamp. Her lecture is really boring. She accepts many students, and most of them did not show up because she just READS the PPT:(, Shes a good professor and helps you prepare for interviews. Choose a reliable partner for the projects as the projects are time consuming so it is necessary to communicate with partner. Tests can be hard.  Sometimes she gives pop quizzes in class. Have your basics clear if you want to do good in her class., One of the best CS classes Ive taken so far.  Challenging at times, but well worth the extra effort.  She was always well prepared for the lectures and was very knowledgeable., She sticks pretty rigidly to the slides in lectures, and sometimes stumbles when asked questions outside of the immediate slide, but is very willing to help and always trying to engage discussion from the class. Written homeworks were hit or miss, but I enjoyed coding hws and felt that they were challenging and applied material well. Grades easy!, best prof ive ever had. challenging class but you learn a lot!, class is about 45 min slides and 30 min practice problems. She sometimes uses interview questions, take her if you wanna get an A"
Mike Wood,/professor/2922737,5.0,100%,2.3,"Hes really nice and teaches very well. His slides are concise and helpful and you can tell hes passionate about what hes teaching. Overall the best CS professor Ive every had., Professor Mike Wood is a caring and respected professor, this course is challenging but manageable and informative, there is weekly homework and a lab as well as some reading assignments and participation points in class. I would recommend this class and professor because Mike Wood is very helpful and responsive. Take him., Loved CS46A with Mike Wood. Assignments can be time consuming, but lots of leniency and extra credit opportunities. Open note and code exams with a very helpful practice test provided. Very easy to get a good grade, would definitely recommend., Professor Mike Wood is a knowledgeable and caring Prof, he is honestly very chill and funny. His teaching style is effective and he gives good feedback as well as help if you go to his office hours, the class is hybrid, 2 midterms and one final, generous extra credit, his class is amazing but beware of the heavy course load it is a fast paced class, The professor is great and explains everything very clearly. Mid terms and final exams are tough but he gives review before exam. One of the best professors., CS122 was great with Professor Wood. He gave very clear, engaging lectures. He was accessible outside of class. The final projects were great. The midterm was a bit challenging with the time contraint but you could make up a lot with extra credits. Makes sure to do your assignment on time., GREAT PROFESSOR NO CAP. Uses lots of examples to demonstrate and help you understand a concept. Responds to the emails pretty fast. And he would be glad to answer any questions you may have patiently., Great guy, the best CS46A course at SJSU. He created tons of examples and participation assignments that were engaging and helped even people with no Java experience like myself get very familiar and confident with using the language. Exams were extremely straightforward, Canvas is always updated with resources, and grading criteria is super clear"
Feiling Jia,/professor/2019310,2.7,N/A,3.8,"Definitely not an easy professor in terms of homeworks and exams. He makes you earn your grade, but at the end of the semester you will know all the work you have done worth it. You will learn by doing the projects and of course the harder, they make you more ready. If you do work for homework you dont need to study too much for your exams., Honestly, one of the worst professors Ive had. He basically copies lectures from other professors. Doesnt contribute in the slightest. Directs all questions to other students. Grader does most of the work. Avoid, if you can!  1 Midterm and 1 Final. Homeworks are not worded correctly. I just hope I pass., This is the most unorganized class Ive taken. Not only does he not know the subject and questions, he redirects any questions to other students.  Participation is counts as a hefty part of your grade and its inconsistent with everyone in the end. Gives quizzes that dont even matter since thats his way of taking attendance., 55% Homework (6 x Questions + Programming in C), 15% Midterm, 25% Final, 5% Attendance. Grade is curved. Class is passable if you dont attend lectures. Jia makes all lecture materials available online. Exams are based far more on lecture materials than anything found in the textbook. Has accent but understandable.  Get there early for a seat!, Be sure to go to class if you dont like reading the textbook. His lectures can be quite long, but the grading isnt so bad. Just make sure you do well on the homework problem sets and dont hesitate to him any questions. He allows many of the homework to be done in groups, which is quite nice., I rank Feiling Jia over Juan Gomez easily. He has an accent, but his English is good, so hes ez to understand. Also pretty chill--kinda stingy about uploading his slides, but he eventually does. Interesting & doable programming hw in C on Linux using VirtualBox. Its somewhat easy to guess the exam qs if you skim the slides and written hw."
Ashish Khanchandani,/professor/2935012,5.0,100%,2.8,"Amazing man. Very passionate and inspirational. Always finds time to answer your questions., Great teaching style, he is that lucky professor you wind up with who you have no trouble understanding. The course itself is very light workload compared to other CS classes so you can take this one without stress. Just be organized and pay attention to the content and youll breeze through it. Easy, yet you actually learn things from the course., He is very enthusiastic about teaching and his area. Make sure to participate and ask questions, and you will pass the class while enjoying it., One of the few professors who actually care about your understanding and progress in the course. He is passionate about teaching and very reasonable with assignments and grading. Tests are all from the lectures so studying the powerpoint as well as attending class is and sure way of doing well in class., Ashish is possibly one of the best teachers I have had in my academic career. He is also a student so he understands the best way to teach us. He is a very lenient grader and both his assignments and tests are practical and fair no curveballs. He has a simple way of teaching that is easy to follow along. Overall he is the GOAT, 100/10 I recommend."
Tran Duc,/professor/2190897,2.3,25%,3.5,"This class wouldnt be so bad if we didnt have to run all our big data tasks locally. It just makes it a complete nightmare to get anything done on our weak machines.  As for the lectures, theyre okay, but the slides are really cluttered with information., Hes clear about what he expects from you in the class by setting a minimum standard but still giving the option to go further and explore for yourself. Learned from online Stanford lecture videos which gave a good basis, and the professor used the class time to focus on important topics for midterms and finals and job advice. Great Professor!, He will post your midterm score and assignment grades on google drive and the whole class can see it. 1 project, 1 midterm, 1 final. He doesnt teach anything in class, you will watch Stanford videos and do the homework and class time is for asking questions. He will randomly ask questions from homework to students in class.  He is ok., He does not explain materials well, and a midterm exam was really horrible. He does not care whether you are in the class or not since attendance is not mandatory. I do not learn anything from him. All he teaches in the class is to explain about online quizzes which come from assignments. Thats it!!!"
Auston Davis,/professor/2104782,3.0,34%,3.3,"The project was the most interesting part of the course. There are a variety of topics that you can choose from. The overall course is overreliant on the textbook by Professor Mark Stamp. We faced too many issues/errors related to questions in the quizzes and exams. The feedback from assignments/projects didnt truly reflect the effort put in., The professor simply reads the slides that have been prepared. There have been instances when he rushes through his own slides and completely changes the meaning of the concept. Too many heavy homework with no feedback on them. Gives full credit for all homework assignments even when students have written wrong answers. Doesnt check or read answer, This guys awesome, and hes very passionate about computer security! The course can be heavy early-on, but gets better slowly. His projects are interesting. Quizzes and exams are easy if you dont skip any class or any chapter. Many things on the quiz are usually what s discussed in class & generally cannot be found on his slides or in the book., Overall course structure is easy and worth taking."
James Casaletto,/professor/2071642,4.7,100%,2.7,"Nice course. Simple grading criteria. Easy to score, One of the best at SJSU. Non ambiguous lectures. Well prepared., I took Big Data subject under James Casaletto. He makes lectures super interesting. He is a born teacher. His grading criteria is also very clear. CS185C is a light course and contains the concepts of Hadoop, Hadoop ecosystem, Spark, Kafka and Machine learning basics & 2labs, midterm, final and project. Course is good for learning, grades and fun."
Punit Sundar,/professor/2592067,5.0,100%,2,"Professor Sundar really helped everyone learn things, and was understanding when someone needed more time or needed the pace of the class to slow down. She was open to extending due dates and giving extra credit for hard exam problems. Really great teacher, and I would definitely take again!, Would recommend you take her course! Super kind and caring professor. Coding is difficult but she guides you thru tons of examples and will always help you on your hw. She is always accessible for you to talk to her. Will always urge you to email for help & not to struggle on your own., This is her first time teaching but she is really knowledgeable and super helpful. She gives us lots of chances for extra credit and her lectures are super clear (might be fast sometimes but feel free to interrupt her if you have any questions). She is flexible with office hours and very approachable. My most favorite class!!!"
Michael McThrow,/professor/2655879,2.3,34%,4.3,"This is the best professor Ive ever met. He is always available in his long office hour and super patient. Ive seen more than three times that he just quickly finish his quick dinner and prepare to answer my questions.(guilty)He can explain things in an easy way. I admire his wisdom for life and teaching., This the WORST class I have ever taken in my entire undergraduate degree. Avoid at all cost, this guy has a main job that he spends all of his time on. He is very vague on what he expect and then grades extremely harshly. You will regret taking any of his classes, Very vague with his assignments. The lectures would kind of help but it was mostly up to the students to read and do the assignments on their own. The labs were relatively easy but the projects were insanely difficult as it would require a copious amount of time. Avoid at all cost."
Amith Belman,/professor/3039911,5.0,100%,2.7,"Dr. Belman is an amazing Professor, and this is also my first time writing an RMP review. He has amazing lectures, and he makes his lectures fun and interesting. Multiple HWs and 2 exams throughout the semester, not so difficult if you pay attention during the lectures. He is also pretty accessible outside of the class. Highly recommended!, Very engaging lectures and gets all the information across in a good manner. Hes very knowledgeable and great at answering questions. Homework is an interesting format, but prepares you for exams well; weekly in class quizzes, one midterm, and one final. Had fun learning!, Despite being a new professor here at San Jose State University Pf Belman exceeded my expectations and helped us incredibly in understanding course material. His Lectures are very detailed and as he is very attentive so he makes sure we all understand the lectures before moving on. As a person, he is very down to earth and friendly!"
Telvin Zhong,/professor/3048474,5.0,100%,3,"The material is well-prepared, and grading is based on group projects, a midterm, and a final. Tests are doable as long as you pay attention to the slides. I recommend doing homework after each week slides because it is related to the tests. Hes knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely cares about his students. Highly recommend!, One of the best professors Ive had. Exam and project heavy, but his class is fair. Good feedback, lectures, and no homework. Hes a young prof thats caring, relatable, and fun. Insightful and relevant content, he truly wants all students to do well. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this class, hes the GOAT., Amazing professor. His slides are very organized and he is good at explaining everything in a very understandable way in lecture. You can tell he is very passionate about teaching and cares to see his students succeed in class and also out of class. Exams are very close to the lecture materials so take good notes and go to class to do well."
Peter McGlaughlin,/professor/2984010,3.7,67%,3,"-> Clear grading criteria. \n-> Very informative slides and lectures. \n-> Would need to attend the lectures to develop understanding. (Highly recommend attending all lectures)\n-> Professor is always available during office hours to solve any doubts or explain concepts.\n-> Exam is conceptual so a good understanding of content is crucial., He has a great knowledge of the subject. His slides sometimes have typos but he acknowledges it (it is normal with the amount of work a first semester lecturer has to do). Office hours were great. My team progressed on the homework a lot and we were laughing all the time., He is generally a good person, but most of the time, he appears to be confused. The slides he uses in class contain inaccuracies, and although he acknowledges the errors and apologizes, it can make the material confusing. The grading system is fair and transparent."
Tsau Lin,/professor/2185484,3.5,50%,4.5,"Very unorganized, his lecture notes and set up for the project (?) are all kept in CS 157A repo. Slides are messy. All he talks about is C stuffs. Straight up dismissed my question for the project (even though I checked with my classmate later and got it right). Will try to update more as the semester goes on., Very unexpected teacher. you will have quiz our of no where. sometime more than 2 quiz in a day. So difficult to understand sometime he doesnt know what he is talking about. Very confusing. If you just want to pass the class he is great. you wouldnt learn much for the first half of the semester. Second half of the semester he go crazy on SQL."
John Pearce,/professor/2185466,3.0,50%,4,"I took his course in Fall 2019, he was a good instructor and his office hours were informative. A concern I agree with others is his ability to respond to emails. Lectures were dry but useful for doing projects and homework. His personality was approachable and friendly in my experience., He make jokes in middle of lecture. He knows his stuffs. EXAMS are extremely hard. In first midterm half of the class get F. But if you do good in final he will help you in your midterm. lectures are boring. most of the class dont even listen to his lectures."
Doug Case,/professor/3015141,5.0,100%,2.5,"Really good understanding professor. Made an otherwise really hard topic somewhat easier and fun to learn with his in class activities. Lectures can be dull at time but would usually always end with in class activities. Really made this course easier than other professors, Professor is good and course work is easy as compared to other professors for this class. He is willing to help you, class excercises were fun and great to learn algorithms. Only con was most of the grade is midterms and final, which were high scoring and was from his lecture slides. This means easy to pass, but not sure about A."
Suhas Chelian,/professor/3062472,5.0,100%,2.5,"Professor Chelian is fantastic. He has detailed lecture slides, provides thoughtful and helpful feedback on the milestones for the project, and cares about his students. He is receptive to student feedback and implements any suggestions right away, making him a good professor. He has a lot of solid industry experience and brings in guest lecturers!, Professor Suhas is an excellent instructor. The lecture notes are detailed and his exams reflect the content covered in class well. He gave extra credit assignments which helped a lot. He also included group projects with detailed instructions and helpful templates. However, releasing the project details a bit earlier would be even more beneficial."
Mohammad Masum,/professor/2875424,5.0,100%,3,"Considerate, has in depth knowledge about the subject. Helpful and approachable"
Guannan Liu,/professor/2978860,5.0,100%,3,"Prof. Lius data viz class was a revelation. Crystal-clear explanations and hands-on practice made complex concepts sing. We learned to craft data stories, not just charts. A must for anyone wanting to master this impactful field."

Debra Caires,/professor/244307,2.3,32%,3.7,"This class can be a bit disorganized, but with some effort and using helpful study tools like Unstuckstudy, you can get a lot out of it. The professor tends to ramble, but engaging with the material and assignments is key to success. Overall, manageable difficulty., The class is really two parts. The first 85% of the class is plain easy, it\s just a bunch of fake diatribes of her experience in the field and light busy work week to week. Then, she assigns the POC at the tail end of the course, and you need to do a couple of all-nighters writing a 50+ page document. So divide your time up carefully beforehand., The entire semester was spent telling irrelevant stories and barely working on the final portfolio, before practically giving up and just throwing the rest of the work at us. Final grammar exam is completely irrelevant to course content, and the entire Proof of Concept is mindless writing. Ignore her and get parts done on your own while she talks., Horrible class. Extremely easy--you literally just need to do your assignments and you will most likely get an A. Lots of fictional stories. She kept talking about how shes a recruiter at Verizon and then from Verizon it went to Yahoo and Boeing and just went on from there. The POC was 50+ pages for most people, and was an actual joke--busy work!, The first half of the class was super light while the second was packed with assignments. She rambles for an hour and doesnt teach anything useful while vaguely mentioning agile principles. This class has very little direction but a lot of assignments. She also lies a lot, so I wouldnt trust her career advice., Her fictional stories about her case experiences takes up most of her lectures. Gives a lot of assignments that will feel irrelevant to your major., This class is doable but super frustrating. Disorganized and has a lot of pointless assignments. My advice is to get the assignments done ASAP, especially the PoC. Always ask for clarification if youre confused, most likely other students are too. As others have said, take what she says with a grain of salt., I dont know how she still teaches; this class is a joke. Nothing is taught in this class. Spends most of her time talking about her nonexisting work experience. Be prepared to put a lot of time into doing HW and POC projects that will take days, if not weeks, to finish., A 20 page paper is required towards the end of the class. ChatGPT didnt exist at the time so the paper took up all my free time/was complete busy work. Theres a grammar exam at the end of the class but she doesnt teach anything grammar related. You also have to use Adobe XD to create an app. The class is way too much work with little guidance, I would advise students to stay away from her, but thats a little difficult given that shes the only teacher who teaches 100W on a regular basis. The class has too much work, and some of her advice should be taken with a grain of salt. The best thing she did for us was teach us how to structure our resumes, otherwise, it was not a helpful class., Debras course was poorly structured, and the Canvas assignments/posts from previous semesters made Canvas a nightmare. She copy & pastes assignment feedback for everyone. Nothing taught for the Grammar Final. Lectures were a negative experience due to disorganization, the participation format, and her disencouraging attitude toward students., While Debra, is a great professor, some of her career advice is to be taken with a grain of salt, that does not mean all of it is bad, just trust your gut than blindly following what she says. Other than that Debra is a decent professor, who makes times for her students, even though she has a busy life outside of being a professor., The canvas page for this class is designed to cause pain and suffering, with wildly incorrect due dates and poor instructions on assignments. Most assignments have no purpose except to waste time, and youll be called on at random to provide your thoughts on whatever she wasted the last 30 minutes doing. This will be your most stressful class., Take this class if you want to hear made-up stories and biased judgement. She told a student who had a LinkedIn profile picture with landscape background that this is bad because people would think you prefer to be outside rather than being indoor coding. Did you even realize how absurd this was? This class is nothing but a waste of time!, She told a student to take a LinkedIn assessment in front of 32 other people and told others to help him. Then she said that all 33 students were not ready for work since he did not pass. Firstly, that would be cheating if he passed. Secondly, dont lower your students self-esteem like that. Debra, if youre reading this, pls dont do this again!, It doesnt take a detective to realize her stories are made up (an engineer fainted since a project was changed? an offer given in parking lot?). Whatever she thinks will make you succeed is not true, at least not any more in a modern tech industry (trust me, I have 5 internships and a 200k new grad offer). Take her if you want to waste your time!, biased and usually gives bad advice. Her stories may trick those w/o experience, but if youre in the industry, youll know her methods are outdated. She made a student take a LinkedIn assessment in front of everyone and told them to help him. Thats CHEATING! In one section she says shes currently at Apple, in another she says Yahoo. What a joke, She is nice person. POC was long but we had a lot of time to do it. A lot of us got A-. Final was grammar test, but was not hard. It was long tho. Take it, do the assignments and you will get good grades. Its online., LOTS OF WRITING called POC (32 pages in total for me No Joke). Each quiz and even final test were not related to what we learned in class at all. No communication and no flexibility., Debra is generally a nice person and she cares about her students\ success. With that being said, her class was rather disorganized. We ended up not using Criterion for the final project (as she planned) because she gave us an invalid signup code. Also, the final portfolio isn\t particularly useful if you don\t have plans for entrepreneurship., This class was hell on earth. Forces students to turn on webcam during lecture - takes 1hr to explain something that could be done in 10 minutes. Leaves out critical instructions for presentations and final project. Doesnt reply to emails. Canvas page is messy; had multiple grading problems. Her career advice is actually detrimental to students., She claims to be accommodating/reasonable, but she is not at all. Nothing is due all semester & everything is squeezed into the last 2 weeks, busiest time for other classes. I didnt have a problem with her at first, but after we turn in the huge final project she blames us for not understanding her vague instructions. We dont have time for this!, We barely did anything that benefits CS students. Be prepared to pay (around $80) to access Pearsons MyLab. MyLab assignments were not related to the class. Be prepared for a lot of busy and unnecessary work. Be prepared for a POC document that it is a lot of useless work. Final exam is a grammar exam? This class is a gigantic waste of time., The worst experience ever. She gives you misleading and outdated career advices that wont help you get a job. Gives lots of meaningless writing assignments instead of polishing a resume (we spent 30 minutes on it in 18 weeks). Doesnt answer questions and talks off-topic too much. Final exam, which we didnt prepare at all, felt out of place. Bad., I felt less betrayed by my ex who cheated on me. I could barely study for my other courses because of how much work I had to do for her class. She constantly contradicts herself. To be fair, decent career advice but not the best. If theres another instructor, youve been dealt a royal flush take it., Don\t expect much good. Yeah, she has you work on a POC, wireframes, qualtrics, and other things, but she doesn\t understand their use. Her background seems to be in HR or something of the sort. She talks herself up. She doesn\t understand business, she just has a few trendy things she likes to teach (learned from a TED talk sometime probably)..., Poorly organized class, textbook homework felt irrelevant, final grammar exam had no build up and felt out of place, and class overall felt like a busy work. Kinda do nothing in the first half of semester, but then she throws the POC outta nowhere. Resume/LinkedIn building was nice, but thats the only positive for me. Class needs restructuring., You dont do anything for the 1st 1/2 of the semester, then youre thrown into POC + Prototype. Canvas page is an absolute mess. Pearson HW is unnecessary. Lectures are disorganized and chaotic, esp. on presentation days, but she thinks its fun for us. Questionable and biased grading system. Blames Canvas when she messes up the peer review system., Very bad course. She really didnt know how to teach this course. Every assignment she assigns is meaningless. At the end of the term is a 15-page paper. To be honest, every assignment she assigns is meaningless. She has always emphasized what is the manager wants to see. . . But She really has no idea what the current job market is like., What a terrible professor, you have to do a lot of meaningless tasks throughout. Just let you do it and wont teach you anything. There is no value, I would never choose her again. I hope she will be expelled from the supervisor and will never teach again. Also, you need to have a good team, because all ratings are team ratings., As a professor and person, I really liked Debra. Cares VERY deeply about the success of her students. Shes on East Coast but had office hours until 3am EST to help with POC. Learned lot about how industry works and get good advice for resume, etc. Felt Pearson HW was unnecessary, but wasnt due til last day. Appreciated her enthusiasm and care., Debra is passionate providing resources to students and teaching. She creates an immersive realistic industry setting in her course; any question that you have will be answered with real examples to substantiate it. After exposure in industry, I realized this course is essential for understanding how to be successful in SWE internships and beyond., I understand why people rate this professor poorly- but I really liked taking her. She pushed me to expand and learn on a more professional scale. Shes always open to questions and critique, and wants you to participate all the time. She is really open to talking and is always willing to help. Great experience overall!, I still keep in touch with Debra two years after I took her class because thats how valuable information she gives and she is a very good connection to have in your network., I got my first internship because of Debra and Debra alone. Her recommendation carries so much weight. I would recommend taking Debra only if youre up for a non-traditional class., Debra is amazing! Would highly recommend her if you want to be successful in your career., Shes an amazing mentor. This is not a typical writing class but Debra prepares you for your career., From an academic standpoint, Debra is likely to rub you the wrong way. From a career standpoint, especially to those with internship experience, youre getting a pretty solid amount of information and introduction to industry. The best bang for your buck if you talk to Debra about non-school related topics during office hours. Engage and thrive!, 100W has a lot of writing but the class is literally named technical writing so I don\t see why people are complaining. She\s one of the most caring teachers I\ve had and her making us go to the career fair got me an internship! She always willing to help and has extra office hours on her own time. I don\t like 100w but Debra is an amazing mentor, i used to enjoy going to class and learning interview tips and how to improve your resume and doing applicable stuff. then we started working on the proof of concept which is basically like a 15 page entrepreneur project to train you to be a project manager for no reason. now i wish i never have to see or talk to debra again. AVOID HER IF YOU CAN., I think I hate this class more than any other class I\ve ever taken. She acts like doing the proof of concept is going to get us a job. Constantly says I\m in the industry and this is what employers want to see. What a waste of time. I would have a MUCH better chance at landing a job if it was a software project or spent the time on leetcode., This class was so overwhelming yet useless. The workload is insane; no way its a 3 unit class. She makes you use sh*tty Adobe products, and now I hate Adobe. The worst thing is that it could be a fun class but she makes it so stressful and serious. If you can skip or take it with someone else, for the love of baby Jesus please do., Debra is nice, but super gossipy. She claims to code but I doubt she can. She claims a lot of things to inflate her reputation. She makes it seem like her class and assignments are super important but they are not. Like many other people have said this class is entirely busy work., This may be your most useless class. Time comsuming and you can learn nothing. If you want to be a product manager or start own business, this class is pretty good. But if you are a software engineer, please stay away from her class. Lots HWs, video resume, 2-mins POC video and 6000+ words POC, 97+ A grade, 94+ A- grade., Shes so great, I dont understand the bad reviews? She goes above and beyond for students, you can reach her outside of class, she connects really well with everyone. She gives great advice on how to email, talk to recruiters, and get internships. The class in general is informational and the semester project is actually very useful., Awful class. All classwork and homework is busywork, as is the PoC. The PoC takes up majority of time, and I found it to be highly irrelevant and pointless. Everything taught by Prof. Caires is either common sense or things you would have learned several times over the years. Overall, while it is not hard to get a good grade, its a pointless class, She is a good professor that you cant even dream for. I can listen to every single word from her but not some other professors. Its your good luck if you can choose her, Not a super hard professor, just gives you a lot of busy work (filling out documents, doing quizzes, submitting discussions). Wish the content taught was more relevant though, sometimes it seemed pointless and didnt seem like it was intended to make us become better technical writers, Shes a nice professor. But her class is not that useful. The POC is useless to most people, because not everyone wants to start their own business. I wish she could spend more time on resume and Linkedin, they are more important than the POC., This is the most caring professor I have ever had. She really wants you to succeed. She is available to every student current and past. Shes always available for advice. She prepares us for the environment in the future by making us do assignments that would be impressive to employers. One critique is she forces us to do English work., Debra is an amazing Professor. She really cares about her students. She was the only one of my professors that knew how to transition to an online teaching environment due to COVID-19. Make sure to do all of your assignments so you dont have to work as hard on your final project! Also, she likes to call on her students randomly during Zoom., You have to take this exact class with this exact teacher so I wont even bother reviewing her. U have 7% of the grade to lose to get A. 60% r basic quizzes/discussion: get full pts on them. 20% for final grammar test: not ez, u can lose 2-3% max on it (10 - 15 pts out of 100). 20% for final portfolio: BS the 2 min pitch, BS the PoC, and ez A., My view of this class may be different from urs bcuz it became online due to Covid 19 (had access to recordings of class, took final online). Material isnt hard, but it could stack up if you procrastinate. There were some unnecessary assignments, but the class helped me build a nice resume and LinkedIn. Learned Adobe XD which was nice. She was ok., Debra wants the best for students but a lot of this class is just busy work for the sake of it. She makes you install Adobe bloatware for the final portfolio under the premise that future employers will like this. Honestly, future employers would rather see you take on coding projects rather than show them you can make a pretty webpage on AdobeXD, I dont see why theres so many bad reviews; all she does is lecture on career topics to help you succeed in your job search. While the work thats graded is completely useless in terms of your career, the class is seriously an easy A. Class is typically lecture Mon/Tues, in class activity Wed/Thurs. Only big deal was the prototype project, ez A+, This was a very useless class. I was hoping I could learn how to write technical reports, but instead, we spent 90% of the class going over resumes and interviewing. The grading criteria makes no sense, and I received 0s on multiple assignments I did and turned in on time., Some of the stuff we learned in class was very useful (like writing resumes or interviewing at companies). Most the rest of the class was useless busy work. She is a very nice teacher, but I would avoid her if you can., 1. Buy the access code only, dont buy the book 2. Online quizzes due every sunday 3. Activities in class matter and you have to submit in-class work DURING class. They are easy. 4. Always come to class 5. Work on your portfolio ahead of time 6. Easy grader, She gave us so many assignments that eventually she herself forgot some of them. We got feedbacks on our very first draft of abstract after we submitted our final paper. Nice person, bad teacher. I think she gave everybody a B at the end., Lacks clear process and makes you work on multiple assignments simultaneously. Grading criteria was tough. Grades didnt reflect effort that was put in. However, she does help with soft skill development., 1. The book cost around 50 bucks to take quiz. The quiz is full of bs. 2. I am shocked of how much of BS she can come up with. 3. On the first class, she asked us to read others POC without telling us what she wants, and expect us to know by reading others. 4. 75% of classes just sitting on the front and write recommendations for former studen, Debra teaches skills that can be used on a career fast-track. Her class is very different and pushes students out of the comfort zone. You must ask questions if youre confused. Study for the grammar test, its very difficult. Tip: Dont do only the bare minimum on Proof of Concept assignments. The work WILL pile up if it is left incomplete., Debra is the sweetest person. If you get to know her, she is incredibly nice and will do whatever she can to help you prosper. The class format changed this semester, so it was significantly easier, theres no semester long project. Like another review said, the grammar final at the end is really difficult, we got a pre final assessment though., Debra is not only a great teacher, she is an awesome career coach. This class is not about coding or program design, but about how to write professional communications, sell yourself on the job market, and get a job. However, do not expect an easy A: you will need to put in some time. Beware of her grammar exam, it is hard, really hard., Debra is a nice person. However, she tried to achieve too many things for students all at once. And thus, her course resulted in many students not knowing what to do and confused. I couldnt really recall what I had learned in the class as she always said a lot of technical terms without giving good examples. I wish she can improve the class., Debra has an admirable vision for the class but falls short when it comes to implementation. Entire class hinges on project which will be a ton of work, and might suck if you get burned with a bad client. Only meets for lecture once a week but a ton of assignments and documentation will bog you down. However she is very open to help when needed., This class consists of 1 big project( pick project and group wisely), 5 blogs that you have to write and publish, 1 grammar test, Resume work, Agile terminology throughout the course, lots of homework, presentations, WebEx meetings with the  professor and your group (2-3 times per week).Only take this class if you have lot of free time or good luck, You dont learn anything technical from this class, nor you do any technical writing. This class will suck up all of your time with group meetings and  lots of homework. Ita lot of self learning for the projects and totally not worth the time and effort at the end. A lot of students cant escape from this class coz of limited sections offered :(, Debra has very good intentions. She wants to teach you the standard practices of the industry. She assigns a semester long group project, but she often gives you documents and expects you to finish them. If she doesnt like them, prepare to revise them many times. Often disorganized and leaves you confused. Forced to use multiple web platforms., Great person, terrible professor. Tries her best to teach what\s part of industry, but is often unconvincing. Highly disorganized. Be ready to constantly check email and a number of different platforms for assignments. Class is dependent on a semester long group project. Try to take class with a friend. Will help in a pinch if asked., Debra is a good person, and shes easy to get along with. The problem is that the class is incredibly unstructured. She tries to help, but most of the time it ends up confusing people, her criteria isnt clear, and the class is far from easy. Massive group project that will take up all your free time., Highly disorganized course that drains far too much of your free time. Debra will constantly assign work without adequately explaining it during lecture. Weekly Webex / in-person meetings are required outside of class time, with a client or Debra, and can end up clashing with your schedule, watch out!   Class is 95% group work after a few weeks in., There were many weeks where she just sat at her desk and said nothing. She spends very little time explaining assignments or providing feedback, and used Facebook for ALL of her announcements. She tends to put up assignments late on Sunday evenings and expects you to finish them by Monday morning. Avoid a having full schedule with her class., Not really a technical writing class as I thought it would be. In this class you write blogs and project documentation, and work with a client on a project of some sort. Stay on top of the work and it isnt that bad. She leaves the class chaotic; just pay attention to it all., How on earth this class received certification for Computer Science Major ? Not every computer scientists is into poster making and taking 6th grade grammar tests... She also makes you to read an outdated 15-year old Agile methodology. Very disorganized and useless class. I want my money back... now., WORST class I have taken in my entire life and I\m a senior. She excuses her disorganization by saying that\s how the real world is. Honestly, I\ve had internships and  full time jobs and NO, the real world is not this disorganized. This class consumes a bulk of your time so avoid taking with too many other classes. Good Luck!, Shes kinda all over the place, very confusing with assignments, and spams your email with vague messages. She has good connections with recruiters though, I just wish her class was more organized. It feels like its disorganized on purpose. She uses facebook for messages, Debra is very eccentric to say the least. The group projects rarely require actual computer science or programming, but are demanding in terms of time commitment nonetheless. It was a pretty stressful class., Her assignments are hard, true. But they give you experience in what CS majors need, mainly projects and customer interaction. Debra is one of the most helpful and well connected people at this school without a doubt. Get on her good side!, Very down to earth and made attending the lectures entertaining. But most importantly made a state-mandated writing class into really useful career coaching. 90% of the work is done outside lecture on your own time but since the lecture only meets once a week that offsets most extra required time., Debra is a great professor. She makes the class lectures fun and entertaining. Granted there is a lot of work expected, but she cancels one lecture every week to give you extra time. Most of it is group work, but she does recognize when people do not work hard and others make up for it. I learned so much from her class and I recommend it., Seems very disorganized but if you talk with her she is helpful, She UNDERSTANDS the computer technology and how to make use of it very well., Debra is quite open to students, but is confusing with her assignments at the same time. I got pretty mixed up, as well as the whole class, over many assignment criteria. But be sure to ask for clarification otherwise no one else may, ending up in the professor not realizing her own unclarity. Ask in front of the class so others dont need to again, Atrocious class. The class is poorly organized, possibly on purpose. CS100W is supposed to be about technical writing, but there wasnt even a cursory treatment of technical writing. The one technical writing assignment you have is just THERE, and there is no lecture leading to it. The class dropbox is overloaded with too much information. Etc., One of the most real professors.  She gives you a lot of work and doesn\t tell you how to manage it.  In a way she is teaching you how to take the things you are given and managing them yourself.But at the same time it isn\t good.  Otherwise, good professor, she is a recruiter , she will pound you on your resume and CVs when the time comes., Prof. Caires offers a well designed class to prepare us for our future. You have to do your part of the work and be willing to figure out things, which sometimes are left unclear, on purpose. She is very helpful and I learned a lot in that class. Is sad that so many people criticize but they simply didnt get the chance at growing up., Worst.class.ever. I really wish it was more like other 100w classes. Debra is very inconsistent with the information she tells from student to student, and does not explain what she wants from you., Im not even halfway through the semester and Im already tired of this b. This is the only class I dread to go to every week. Thank god you only meet up once a week, or I would die. She likes to spam your email with separate emails about one subject. She does not even have any background in CS. She is horrible at giving instructions.Useless class, I cannot believe I am saying this right now, but this is the most stressful class out of my schedule. And Im talking some pretty challenging and difficult classes. We havent done much in this class yet, but trust me, when you have no idea what the hell youre doing every time you walk into a classroom, you will feel the burn. Horrible professor., Shes really nice if you go in and talk to her one-on-one and listen to her stories. However she is unclear at times, but if you ask her for help with precise questions, she can really help you. As long as you keep up with the work and dont slack off, youll have an easier time with this class. Also, dont bite off more than you can chew., Ive never had a professor be so unclear about assignments. I worked my butt off, compensating for some useless group members, and didnt get my A. I did thrice the work required, but I dont receive thrice the grades. Everything in this class is group work. Computer Science majors who have yet to take her class, I salute you..., Easily gets off tangent but extremely approachable. Pray to god that your group members arent slackers or you will hate this class. Be prepared to visit her often during office hours to have the homework clarified or else you and your team mates will be lost. Key to passing the class: team work and office hours. Otherwise, this class was fun for m, Professor Caires is an extremely nice, and well meaning person. The toughest challenge students will find is figuring out what is expected. Make sure you ask her for clarification and you DO turn something in, youll be fine, she will tell you exactly what to correct to re-turn it in. Make sure you join a large group, with people who WILL work!, The work in this class was tedious, but it was NOT hard. Follow the coversheets and make an effort. Debra is truly an amazing individual if you get a chance to talk to her. She has a big heart! I enjoy her anecdotes in class, and it sure as heck beats lecturing from powerpoint. If you allow yourself to, youll get something out of this course., Shes OK. I guess. shes the only teacher for this required course, and be ready when you take it because its a roller-coaster!!!, From an A student:\n Easiness: She gives fifteen extra pages of writing beyond the 8000 word requirement, claiming that it will meet Area R.  It won\t.\n Helpfulness: You can email her, but her answers are useless.  I asked her an X or Y question and got back Yes.\n Clarity: The directions for one assignment were spread out across five emails., Her instructions are vague and she is never clear about her requirements for assignments. Most of your time in this class will be spent trying to figure out what she wants you to do. Its been a very frustrating experience, so I implore anyone seeking an 100W to look into the Engineering departments 100W rather than this one., Spends so much time talking herself up and failing to convince the administration to increase the unit rating to actually spend time helping students and so leaves everything to the students. Information presented is common sense but treated as extremely important. Abandons students to figure out what she wants as far as assignments content., This teacher is all right.  Shes nice and has some funny stories to tell to make the lectures entertaining.  The only problems I have with the class are 1) the ridiculous amount of crap we have to print and turn in with every paper 2) the fact that you have to follow HER format on every assignment you turn in 3) the Newsletter., She gets a lot of ratings. As you can see, its not just from a few hateful students.She will load you up with unreasonable work and give you no time to finish. She will make you do accounting work in a technical writing class. Her assignments are not hard, they are just tedious and long and unnecessary. They will drive you crazy. Thumb down., All i am going to say is...Good luck. because u will need EVERY bit of luck u can get. and i mean that with all my heart., The class is required for CS and she is the only teacher.I knew this teacher would be bad before I started the class. Nothing anyone told or could of told me would prepare me for this class. The class is horrible. She is just horrible.But plain and simple you have no idea what to do for the assignments. Good luck trying to get ?s answered by email, DO NOT TAKE. this professor will make your life miserable. She will not explain ANYTHING and will expect you to figure it out on your own. All she does is talk about her self and how great she is. Everything done in class is useless and time consuming. One of my midterm papers was 25 pages long and i still got a B-. DO NOT TAKE!, Took in Fall 2008. This semester she made the class alot easier compared to previous semesters. Dont buy the Bedford handbook, there is no use for it! I wasted $50. Total costs for materials was ~$50 for color printing, poster boards, etc. Its easier at the beginning of the semester but you will do alot of work near the end. (PART 1/2), PROS: Only spent $60 for this class, not $200.  Easy to get good grades on assignments if you follow her templates.  CONS: Lots of research and lots of writing.  Cant stand her lectures.  Overly dramatic and cant stop talking about how great she is!  MY ADVICE:  She wont tell you how to do the assignments so ask LOTS of questions.  Good luck!, Very unclear in her assignment. Requirement can change at will. If there is another alternative professor teaching 100W, nobody would take this professor. Prepare to spend some money. Otherwise I got some interview tips from this class., Lot of people said shes hard and her class is not useful. I also have some friends took her class for more than 3 to 4 times. But for me shes not that bad. Just "
Qi Yang,/professor/2576815,1.8,26%,4.3,"Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 46A professor @ SJSU when I took the class. I regret not waiting because his class was hell since he made me and my classmates cry feel dumb as he expected novice coders to be fluent in Java., This was the worst professor I ever had. He expects students in an Intro to Programming course to be fluent in Java and due to his heavy accent, nobody understands a word he says. I am so glad that he no longer teaches CS 46A., If you took his class, you would know exactly the definition of a nightmare. He just read off the slides, which was not helpful since he has a super thick accent, resulting in nobody being able to understand him. He expected novice coders to be fluent in Java, and was condescending when discussing the courses difficulties., This was the worst professor at SJSU hands down. I had never been in a class before where I left more confused. He was the worst professor in the history of SJSU. He expected beginner programmers to be fluent in Java and was condescending when discussing the difficulty of the class. I am so sorry if you were stuck to take him., Does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept and skips multiple steps when teaching. Very condescending., How did SJSU hire him? Im so glad they got someone else to teach 46A since this guy is a joke and expects people with little to no coding experience to be experts in Java on the first day. Students needed outside resources if they wanted to pass., This professor was the worst! He never helped his students out with anything as he expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java., So glad hes no longer at SJSU., A really easy class to get an A in if you do homework and put in the work to learn coding. The lectures are alright but the slides are great and help you learn. Instructions are somewhat unclear. Tests have same difficulty as practice. Overall, great professor and I really enjoyed his class., He taught the class without knowing the title as he believed all 100+ students in his Introduction to Programming in Java class were fluent in Java. He also has a heavy accent so no one can understand a word he says and is intimidating when he talks about the difficulty of the class, which discourages lots of students., As an Introduction to Programming class, this was one of the hardest possible classes ever. Poor teacher, bad at explaining, constant amounts of homework, massive difficult semesterly exams. The difficulty of this class is higher than it needs to be. AVOID AT ALL COST, try to transfer., If you get this professor, take my advice and drop his class within the easy drop period. His lectures are pretty much garbage and he expects students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java., This was one of, if not THE worst teacher I ever had. He did not help you that much whe students asked for it. He was very hard to understand due to his accent. Then when you have to turn in your homework, he makes you do it the exact way he wants to do it or else you do not get credit., Why would SJSU hire such a terrible professor? He expects programmers in an Introduction to Programming class to be fluent in Java and does not know how to explain problems well. Also, when you ask him questions he does not know how to provide answers and often discourages students. If you have him I suggest dropping (which is what I did)., He is pretty hard to understand in class because of his thick accent and because he goes extremely fast in his lectures. He also uses software that he specifically says that he does not know how to use (iClicker) and expects students with little to no coding experience to be fluent in Java. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, try to transfer., Does not care if students understand the material or not. Questions asked in class are usually deflected. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands Java when they are just beginners. He is also very condescending and intimidating., Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 46A professor when I got to SJSU. He expects novice coders to be fluent in Java and used software he specifically stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker). He was also intimidating and his accent made it hard for us to understand things., The WORST professor Ive ever had at SJSU. His teaching methods are very unclear and hes very unhelpful. He only teaches to get paid. Assignments are SUPER hard. He expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java and does not review the material. Just awful. Avoid him at all costs!, Usually I take RMP reviews lightly since most people will only speak on their bad experiences but TRUST ME WHEN I SAY HE IS GENUINELY A TERRIBLE PROFESSOR. He expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java and I do not think he cares about the success and well-being of his students. Extremely hard professor for NO REASON. Avoid at all costs, I dont believe it. No matter what it had taken for me to get right, this professor has been throwing away points on all assignments, because he never showed any sufficient examples in lecture. He also uses software he specifically stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker) and expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java., Does not care if students understand the material or not. Questions asked in class are usually deflected. His teaching method does not even make sense and expects his students to be fluent in Java despite the course being an Intro to Programming class., Horrible and extremely intimidating professor. Do not even bother with this professor. Drop the class if you can and save your GPA. The lectures were bad, he did not care about anyone, and he never helped his students out with anything., Terrible instructor, he doesnt even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how the university would hire someone this bad to teach. He is extremely strict, his lectures are confusing and he doesnt explain clearly. His exams are very hard, he expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java. Please do the students a favor and fire him., Professor yangs lectures consist of him reading off slides and disregarding any questions about the code on the slides. I would recommend you be familiar with Java and some programming syntax in order to really excel in this class, otherwise you will have a hard time as Professor Yang is not very helpful., This professor was the worst! He does not even deserve the professor title. I do not understand how SJSU hired someone this bad to teach. He never helped his students out with anything, lectures were bad, and he used software (iClicker) he specifically said he did not know how to use. Listen to the rest of the reviews and do NOT take the teacher., He does not know how to teach at all since he just read off of the slides and was intimidating when he talked about the difficulty of the class by saying if the class was too hard, we could switch to CS 22A. IDK how he expects students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java., I only took his class for a week and am so glad I dropped it. He expected students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java. He also uses software he explicitly stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker) and was intimidating by saying, If you think this class is too hard or going too fast, you can switch to CS 22A., This is honestly the worst professor ever. He just reads off the slides during lectures and cannot provide insight on how to code. He is also intimidating when talking about the difficulty of the class and uses software (iClicker) he does not know how to use., Worst professor ever. He is condescending towards his students when talking about how hard the class is and just reads off the slides during lectures., Other than being unable to understand what he says due to his heavy accent, he scares his students about how hard the class is and expects students in an Introduction to Programming class to be experts in coding. I also did not understand why he used iClicker when he specifically told his students that he does not know how to use it., He mainly gets a bad reputation due to his accent during lectures, but he has good slides you can follow on your own. Also he gives plenty of time for homework and exams, and makes it clear what hell take off points for. \n\nExams also resemble practice exams and lectures so its easy to pass if you actually try., Bad lecturer, can seem a little harsh at times regarding the difficulty of the class. However, I had no prior coding experience and was able to complete the exams with a lot of extra time. The slides he presents are really useful and give examples similar to those on the homework and in-class problems (which the exams are very similar to)., Yang is a horrible lecturer, and cannot provide any insight into how to write code. But that does not mean his lecturers are unimportant. If you are present during lectures and pay attention, you can do the exams in less than 40 minutes with no problems. There are tricks and clarifications on coding assignments in his lectures., This is the worst professor ever. I dont know why a professor teaching an Intro to Programming class expects his students to be experts in coding. He should not be a professor because he is mean and does not know how to teach., I do not understand why he expects his students in an Intro to Programming class to be experts in coding. I also do not understand why he uses iClicker after he tells his students he does not know how to use it. I\m so glad I dropped his class., Heavyish accent. His lectures were him reading off of his slideshows while showing off some examples of code he would run us through. Online textbook where quizzes were held, participation assignments every session, HW due every week, 2 midterms + final. Start assignments early and use the discord for help! Simple class but requires effort., Ok, Im gonna be honest, this is the worst teacher that I have ever had. I cant understand half the things he says, when you ask for help or advice he is either confused or dosent fully explain it. The finals are a huge part of your grade so watch out., Homework assignments will eat up your time, so make sure to start them early. Has a heavy accent, so its pretty hard to understand what hes saying. Tests were formatted exactly like the homework assignments, but were more difficult and you had much less time to do them., I took it in 2021 fall as a hybrid class. Be ready for lots of hw and labs every week, not a really a hard grader. If you have no experience with coding, dont take it it will be a struggle. He just read off the the slides during his lecture class., The professors class is really lecture heavy. There are homework and participation assignments when I took him last semester, with the graders sometimes being very picky when it comes to taking off points. Study the hw and pars and you will be fine. HOWEVER, this class is not beginner friendly, so beware of that., Worst CS professor ever, reads off the slideshow the entire time and expects you to understand Java fluently. Graders are very dumb and mark down points for unnecessary things, This class really is not a introductory class and gives many new CS students a bad first experience with CS. It is as if the class wants you to change your Major. Topics are explained as if you know Java already. Tests are actually quite fair as it is open notes. If you know some Java, you should be OK, otherwise look for others for help., He is a good teacher. He often reads the comment section and then answers student questions. Most of the tests are not difficult, the last questions in the final exam are not easy, but as long as you hand in, he will give 5 points, so it is really easy to pass this course. You only need to complete all the exercises in the book, Tests are based on lectures. Ask questions by going to his office hours and/or emailing him as he is very helpful. This classs difficulty increases exponentially as time passes. He tries his best to help. Remember that ultimately it is the level of determination and persistence that you have which determines your success and not the professor., 2 tests(4 q\s), 1 final (6 q\s). Both are open notes Tests  fair, study the review well Final  unfair, study the review well and pray he is merciful for the 6th challenging problem As a professor  Exists. He will NOT let you make up assignments for ANY points even if something beyond your control happens. Slideshow lectures (decent info)., I personally enjoyed Yangs class, and about like 80% of the students got at least a B- in his class. Make sure to make/join the discord server for his class, super helpful, and also pay attention to deadlines and to the assignment prompts. No group assignments besides partner work in the lab, and about 4-8 assignments per wk, most of it was ez., Qi Yang is a very complicated professor, that enjoys giving work, he once said If this class is too hard, you can always switch to an easier one Its okay if you are not good at computer science, you can always switch majors This class will discourage you if you are a beginner, do not take it as a beginner you will definitely struggle, Not an intro to java class. Lots of work, and put a lot of effort studying., Total 11 homework, 1 per week, 23 participation assignments, 1 every lecture. Lots of slides to read, lecture wont be that helpful but you should attend for iclicker. Hes very lenient when grading exams with partial credit, You wont fail if you did your readings and notes. Best tips is to organize every file with specific names, useful for exam., very organized class, but many moving parts (participation, quizzes, hw, labs - all of these every week), but it is good preparation. I would say the hardest parts are the exams - you have to work really quick to get to all the problems, so practice by timing yourself. I didnt have any prior experience and I got an A, just do the work, Really liked the structure of this class. There was a lot of HW, which provided a lot of preparation for the tests and helped to quickly get us comfortable with Java. Didnt find the lectures very useful, but this class is an easy A if you are experienced in coding in another language already. The exams consist of coding problems similar to the HW., Qi Yang deserves a low score because the class is not Introductory. In fact, he recommends you have prior coding experience. The homework\s/Timed tests are heavy if you are new. I formed a study group, hired a private tutor, did his HW, still got a C+. Please learn coding prior to entering the class! Don\t make the same mistake as I did., As an international student with no prior programming knowledge, his accent was hard to understand at the start but then it got easier. Do the pre-class work and homework and youll be fine. Read the book tests are usually the same as the homework. He teaches from PowerPoint presentations. Tests are time heavy. Not a bad experience overall!, This class is gonna be tough especially if you dont have any prior coding experience. If you put in the effort and read through his slides and textbook, you should do fine as long as you understand what is being taught. Be cautious when coding as he is very particularly and strict about the styling. His lectures arent the best, but are sufficient, Grading is very strict on homework and tests. If you are new to programming, etc this class will be much harder so you have to make sure to study a lot on your own time, etc. A few good things professor does is give participation problems after classes and replaces your second midterm score with your final exam score if you do better on the final., The HW and tests are not beginner friendly. Graders take off points on homework for the tiniest things, so it wont hurt to triple check your work before submitting. Profs lecture slides are good, but his actual lecturing could use some work., The power-point format that the professor uses isnt for everyone. I wish he would have explained terms more in-depth rather than just reading off the screen. He is a fairly nice person, though the TAs grade for every little mistake. This class is test-heavy and will be difficult for people without prior programming experience. Good luck!, He isnt the worst of professors, he can be difficult to understand sometimes. His lectures arent super useful but attend anyway. Take the help of TAs, your classmates, his slides, office hours, create a discord server. Really do your homework and quizzes. Go through the textbook and you will be fine. Go in expecting to work., dont bother showing up to the lectures, biggest waste of time. you are better off reading from the textbook and self-teaching. the homeworks take a few hours to complete if you dont know what youre doing. the exams are pretty easy for the most part, but the wording of some prompts are questionable., Stopped showing up for lectures even though attendance is mandatory. Professor Yang could use a lot of improvement in his lectures, as they are often pointless summaries of the readings. You\re better off getting help during his office hours. Homework problems are engaging but do not reflect real-life problems, and exam problems are difficult., I dont think Professor Yang is a bad teacher, I just dont think his teaching style lines up with the CS46A curriculum. The exams were extremely long and as someone with decent prior experience in software I wasnt ever able to complete them, yet there was seldom a curve applied meaning most of the class just failed. Id give him a second chance., Hes a nice guy, doesnt speak English very well but will do his best to answer your questions. The problem is lecture, he does not go very in depth and if you have no prior programming experience do not take 46A with him, which is kind of ridiculous since this is supposed to be an introductory class., Amazing guy, He doesnt give good feedback and is really boring. Probably need some programming experience before taking this class in order to do well. Study hard for the exams!, Mr Yang is an okay teacher, though his accent makes lots of his lectures harder to understand. Tests are long and you are only given an hour. If you are new to CS, find another teacher. The TAs grade SUPER harshly and you get minus points for every thing thing. Forget some java doc? -1. Code not neat? -2. Read the book and format your code right., Professor Qi Yang is not for everyone. You will defiantly need to understand or have prior programming knowledge. His exams are long and it will be likely that you will not able to finish. He has thick accents so get ready to be confused. Homeworks are fare, not really that hard. My advice is to watch videos and do homework. Good luck., Honestly the hardest teacher I have ever had. He doesnt know how to teach at all and this class is pretty much impossible unless you have a solid background of computer science already. Its sad because it is supposed to be an introductory class and is meant to teach you. The class is so fast paced and theres also a ton of assignments and lessons"
Chris Pollett,/professor/214943,3.3,53%,3.7,"Memorizing for a database course is crazy. Even worse than Mike Wu., The class coverts way too much material, but most of it is not on the exam. Just practice his old one exams and read through ALL of the slides. His exams have a guaranteed 2 questions from practice exam and 3 for final. So, not a tough class overall. Just spend some time learning and youll get an A. His curve is quiet generous as well., Lectures can be dense with material.  This class covers a lot over one semester.   At one point we were about 2-3 lectures ahead, and then some how got behind a lecture by the end of the semester.  \n\nMidterm and Final was hand written, closed notes, closed book., His slides are too dense with information so get ready to memorize. His homework is a mix of coding and textbook problems. The tests are a bit difficult but it seems he reuses or modifies his exam problems. So try to know how to do his previous semester exam problems., Covers too much material (many are meant for OTHER courses) and poorly explains them. Expects students to memorize an ungodly amount of information and small details (an entire textbook). Those details make it hard to remember the important points of a concept. Exam questions are random, so he may completely skip a topic. HW doesnt prepare you., His slides are helpful since it shows code examples but has a lot of information. His HW are challenging but you can work in a group for them. HW build on top of each other so keep up with the material. I recommend going to his office hours for help. For his exams, study his practice exams from his previous semesters. Overall, an okay professor., 5 HWs, first one is easy, but the rest are hard and feel draining. Have option to do them on their own, but you kinda have to do them in groups because they are a lot of work. 55% is a C-, easy to pass, hard to get a good grade. Too much PHP, I wish the class was focused on Javascript, I didnt like this class as much as I thought I would., Pollett is incredibly knowledgable and passionate for web development.\n\nHowever, he makes this ELECTIVE class an incredible pain to take. In-person midterm and final where you write CODE with pencil and has a terrible hw3.\n\nMan made his class so unnecessarily hard he had to include cheats so everyone somehow passes.\n\nWhat a joke., - Homework is hard and vague (especially for the coding part). Do expect heavy coding.\n- He usually doesnt quite know the details of the homework and even changes the requirement two days before the deadline\n- Heavy test but quite easy as long as you attend every course\n- Midterm and Final are hard and heavy memorizing (terms + math formula), If you want an A in this class (which nobody got), get ready to memorize every single slide. His midterm and final questions were vague and random, with ALL short answer. 5 homework assignments. It is not too hard to pass the class since a 50% is passing, but due to the insanely hard tests and harsh grading, it is nearly impossible to get an A., There will be a class activity and quiz every week, very easy if you review the slides before class. The course is heavy on midterms and finals which involve a good amount of memorization. There are 5 assignments that are very much doable if you have some idea of python and speak to the professor to understand what is expected. Everyone got an A/A-, 5 HWs, 1 midterm, 1 final. 1 in-class exercise & quiz every week. Do the in-class exercises cus they give insurance points for midterm and final (very difficult). Average scores incl. insurance points: midterm 13/20, final 14/30. Lectures are super boring and taken straight from the textbook. Put in effort and youll pass prob. No one got an A., Really great! Participate in class and ask questions! Hes really nice. The homeworks were super hard, but you can form a group, so do it! The tests are kind of hard, but hell give you bonus points. He doesnt always give enough examples for coding stuff, but hes open to talking and helping you always, so its not so bad. Would take again!, The way this class is setup, its impossible to fail. As long as you turn in something for all homeworks, do in-class problems and quizzes you will pass. You will need to work very hard for an A though, Chriss homework assignments are no joke. Exams are hard but there are a lot of safety nets to get points back. The class is fair but a time sink., Somethings you should know before taking CS154: He teaches this class as an abstract math class He reads theories, definitions, or lemmas and DOES NOT provide examples He assumes you understand everything after reading it once He expects you to spend 1-5 hrs on hw (it takes longer) The midterm was take-home (due to COVID) and took everyone 5-8 hrs, Weekly quizzes (Mondays) and in class activities (Wednesdays). A really solid professor. His exams are doable. His homeworks do take a while but stress important points. Overall, I liked him., 50% of your grade is hw, which is great, but it will also take a serious amount of time to complete them and they will not be easy. Post lectures online. There will be quizzes every week which you must be present for. You will need at least 55% to pass, but going into the final the students class average was about.... you guessed it 55%, Dr. Pollett is by far one of the best professors at SJSU. His lectures are heavy but if you put in the time you can do very well. He gives out extra credit points very often, so come to class. All lectures are recorded and all slides are posted online so there are no excuses for not passing the class., As a professor one of the best at San Jose State, but the slides could use an update, they make lectures boring. Sometimes the lectures are just too much to take in and the examples are very simple compared to the actual problem. But you can always clear these things as he is approachable and will help you in his office hours., He is one of the best professor at SJSU CS department. His assignments are good. You will get to learn a lot. He is extremely helpful. Course syllabus is good. Course assignments were in PHP. I heard that next semester he is introducing some Node JS stuff as well. If you want to learn server side web programming, then go for it., Gives lectures slides online and video recording of lectures, but his lectures are boring bc he likes to give unnecessary details about some concepts. For hw, he expects you to have understood the new languages (PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL) within a short timeframe and write complex programs with them. Hw instructions are poorly formatted & worded., Very knowledgeable professor. Quiz every week., Dr. Pollett is tremendous and by far the best professor I have had at SJSU.  The class is challenging but if you work and study hard, you should be fine.  He is friendly, approachable, and willing to help you with the harder concepts during office hours.  I recommend Dr. Pollett and this class to everyone who wants to learn artificial intelligence., Theres a ton of material in AI, and its all weird, wild, and new, but Pollett does EVERYTHING to make the class doable. 55% is a C-. Quizzes are EZ (just review the lecture slides, which are ALWAYS available). Drops ur lowest HW and 3 quiz scores. Gives xtensions on HW. HW is in Python, so this is a python class 2. Gives extra credit. Good prof., Dr. Pollet clearly knows his stuff, but he assumes that you have a strong background in programming and will constantly spew technical terms (and ummuh) in his lectures. The assignments and exams are very difficult, though its offset by very generous curves and extra credit.  Go to his office hours because hes quite a nice and helpful person., He is really smart, and class topic is interesting. However, he doesnt really know HOW to teach topic. Grading is fair, but exam is hard, Hard class. Hes reasonable. very low MT score(4/20), gave us half pts back, did all the Hw(6/10 difficulty). Got only half the quiz points and +5 bonus for rand stuff. Walked into the final passing (55/100 = c-). Final was easier then MT. Grading system is strait forward knew my score and what i had to do to pass (whole class is out of 100 pts), He limits his office hours a lot since he uses that time to write his slides. He then proceeds to take class time to fix his typos in PHP. Stumbles over reading his slides the whole time without much input when a question is asked. Class average on the one and only midterm was a 20% but he was nice enough to allow redos to earn points back :)., Not good. Its been 9 years since hes taught the class. His grading is inconsistent, you wont know what you did wrong because hell grade differently even if its the same work twice. Avoid at all cost., Very hard class! Especially the homework., His lectures are unclear and unexplained,  he grades like its a pass fail class, Grades everything this way: 100%, 50%, or 0%, 55% is a C-, more than half of the class is currently failing. He is a teacher that never took a teaching class. The subject is hard to begin with, but the way he teaches it compounds the difficulty. STAY AWAY AT ALL COST!, Overall a good learning experience, he is straight forward, humble, full of enthusiasm, knowledgeable and crystal clear grading policy., The material was very interesting and he was good at explaining it. However, instead of being an Android/iOS/HTML5 course he really should have chosen one subject. Tests you on what you can memorize from an extremely broad range of problems across all three languages, which is ridiculously daunting. Took this class for enrichment; wish I hadnt., One of the good professors at SJSU CS dept. All his courses are worth every penny. Very helpful and has very good knowledge of subjects he handles. Very humble, non-biased , Creative and fun loving person., Best teacher ever at SJSU CS or Engineering. About the only other decent one is Mark Stamp. Actually explains things well and doesnt leave you wondering what you are supposed to be learning or doing., Very helpful and resourceful instructor. He is one of the few professors that will spend time making sure you understand the concept (if you ask for help). He isnt that easy though just to warn you all., Terrible! Expected us to write an interpreter as a second assignment and expected us to know how to program finite automatas! CS154 is NOT a pre-req for this class, nor is this class a compiler design class. Third assignment was to write an interpreter for C++ and didnt even tell us how to parse the language...thanks., Great professor, technically sound... explains all concepts clearly.. helps a lot during office hours... good grading.. everyone must take his class at least once, Lectures are UN-structured.  Reads directly off of his slides (available online) without giving any further input.  Slides were copied directly from the textbook.  Says umm uh umm uh a lot.  Midterm and final are ridiculously stringent. Asks open-ended questions and expects an exact, specific answer.  No partial credit.  DON\T take him!, This was a tough subject. There is a lot to cover for web programming. So many web programming languages. Not what I expected, but I made it. His midterm and final is pretty hard because there is so much information to retain for it. From what I heard from his semester at Mozilla, he made the class much harder than before., Very hard subject. So much stuff to go through and cover. He has very through slides that covers everything he teaches. His midterm and final is tough. Assignments are pretty challenging as well. According to others, he is much harder than in previous semesters., Very unavailable. fairly rigid in grading. I liked the subject more before I took the class with him. Pretty knowlegeable in the subject but poor presentation. records and posts his lectures. Posts his lecture notes. Could have done better if he was more available. Does NOT respond to individual email period. no chance for late assignments, Still very organized, clear, approachable, and relevant, Dr. Pollett has improved his oral presentation skills dramatically since my last review in 2006.  Hes rapidly grown to be one of my favorites in the department., Very good Professor. Has total clarity and command on the subject. Homeworks are extremely interesting and hard. Extremely helpful, answers every question. Grading is like, you earn what you deserve. Wonderful Prof!, Rocking!!......Helpful, Professor Pollett is good. The material itself is hard.Lots of extra credit to pull your gade up . His exams are hard , but gives you extra credit for it. Final is hard though. Easy to pass this class., He is systematic and well prepared, but with tendency to make the material boring. Challenging assignments but in groups, exams are average in difficulty., This class is a nightmare. It has nothing to do with programming, it is a bunch of totally useless theoretical bullsh*t. They sould change the name of the class to Math-154. If you can get a C- in this class then you are a genious. His lectures are annoying...he can\t talk properly...all he says is um um um...ok., Very organized and heavily streamlined class.  Mediocre presentation (I counted one lecture--he had an average of one um or uh every 6 seconds!).  That said, the assignments are challenging and instructive and he is a mite hard on grading exams.  He\s not horrible, and has potential for being really great with a bit more work on presentation., Lectures consist of material copied right out of the book. Homework must be done in LATEX typesetting format and question as is most of the material for the class is VERY abstract. Grading is even worse. Answers must be in the exact language that he wants, which is basically plagerising the book. Any partial credit given is not nearly noticeable., Great professor. His classs emphasized on HWs, usually 40%. Lots of extra credits to improve ur grade. Never went to his class much due to work but still doing very well by just going over study guide on his website. Very patient with questions in person and emails. Highly recommnded!, his lecture style bored me.  his assignments take up a lot of time.  the exams and the final were easy, though., Definately take this prof for every class you can. He has a great curve and grading scale, cuz he puts more emphasis on HW rather than exams. With other teachers if u screw up an exam you are finished, but Pollet cares more about hw, which is good cuz his HW are challlenging, but u learn a lot from doing them and they can be fun. Overall a cool guy, Midterms are easy.  Final very difficult.  Lecture pure boredom.  Dudes very lazy., Homeworks take too much time and are not really related to the Object-Oriented subject. His teaching style is basically making slides that are quotes from the book (with typos) and reading the slides in class. Seems like a waste of time. Can drive you nuts with his eh-ah-ooh that he keeps saying between every two words., Good job teaching class. Material gets a bit dry while covering SQL language. Gives examples of theoretical stuff. Exams arent hard but do require some memorization of code, which sucks. Grader was decent and quick. Organized in how he posts powerpoint slides for lectures to his site, which just contain info from the book. Book is effective., good in teaching and grading, I had pollet for game programming. TAKE THIS CLASS if you like games. The text was dry at times, and sometimes the lectures were too. But overall Pollet is excited about games, and will give you good tips to definitely help you understand how games are put together. At firs the framework is a bit daunting but Pollet does a good job of explaining it, Very fun class, but so much to cover in so little time so clarity in the lectures will be superficial, READ THE TEXT. More than a crash course in C++ will be needed or you will have a hard time. Very approachable, go to him with any questions outside of class, especially on the final projects. Will write letters of recommendation on a good grade., lectures are boring, uses dried up makers so you cant read what he writes, and stands in front of it. Posts solutions to practice tests late, like one day before the test, irresponsible. ambiguous questions on exams. takes a fun subject and make it uninteresting., hotty, No Comments, His teaching style is a little boring. But you can still learn from his class. Homework and midterms are reasonable, not easy, not hard. Very nice guy. Always willing to help., Hardest class youll EVER take.  He is a nice guy but the material is very demanding.  Plan on spending all your spare time trying to decipher the material."
Ali Arsanjani,/professor/2439205,4.3,95%,3.7,"He has experience in his field and also in teaching. He is committed to teaching and he is reachable at any time. Dont be afraid to reach him for help., One of the best Professors in my entire masters journey. He has in-depth knowledge of ML. He guides in the right direction for any problem. The assignment focuses on learning concepts he thought. I would recommend taking the ML course with this professor., He definitely answers any of the queries over slack through out the week. And dont just have to wait for office-hours., He is an amazing professor with great industry experience. His practical teaching approach helps us to learn more easily. He is easily available outside the classroom to provide more knowledge and patiently clears doubts., The Professors way of teaching the ML concepts is really good.

Would have definitely learned even more., First time learning ML, but professor is engaging and knowledgeable., Professor helps you understand machine learning concepts in depth and via a very hands-on approach. Always accessible on slack, ping him any difficulty and be sure to receive an answer. The weekly office hours are extremely valuable if you have specific queries make sure you get them clarified., Prof. Arsanjani is a very decent choice for ML.

He makes students work hard for the grade, which is a good thing., He teaches ML in depth using various projects and homework which make you understand the subject very well., The professor is very responsive. Any time you have a question, just ask. No matter how stupid the question may be, the professor will answer you patiently. Task sometimes could be very abstract and thus could be hard. Just try to do things that come up in your mind. If thats wrong, he will guide you base on that., Great class, but lots of homework., Great class from someone whos had a lot of experience in the industry! Homework does take quite a bit of effort if you have no ML background but hes a generous grader as long as he sees that you put in effort., Prof Arsanjani is excellent. His class is interactive of sorts. Weekly Standups on the projects you are working on. Easily approachable outside the class., Like his approach of teaching. His classes are very hands-on. Need to spend some time and effort but I would say it is worth it., I enjoyed classes from professor a lot. Liked his approach to teach based on ongoing projects. This gives a lot of clarity and helps in understanding concepts as we can directly relate each technique and concept with ongoing project and see the practical applications. Also professor is approachable outside class to understand concepts deeper., Lectures are engaging and lots of discussion happens in the class. Professor always ensures that we understand the topic., Professor is very good. He always new ideas. But the deadline is not reasonable all the time. But overall he is very helpful and approachable., Its really good that professor points us to many links which are really useful., Overall had a good experience.

He is accessible even after the class and gives good feedback., Very practical course, Good lectures., Hes been the best till now in such an online learning environment. Hes generous , gives personal attention to his students and is always available on slack to solve doubts. He personally helped me catch up with the coursework adjusting with remote work culture and gain back the momentum solving ML complex problems. Highly recommended. Thumbs up., Professor Ali brings to the table his immense professional experience along with academics and I really learned a lot from his lectures and mentoring sessions. His assignments contain reading work that provide additional insights to the lessons learned in classroom and there is also a lot of hands-on learning involved., CMPE257-Machine Learning : since he is in industry, he has a good view of where ML currently is in Industry Acceptance. class will be good if you are looking for application specific ML course this is for it. Dont expect research or math heavy stuff. Irrespective of COVID-19 your classes will be mostly online., He makes more practical touch to all theoretical understanding. His explanations on how to approach new datasets are really helpful to solve Kaggle problem. NLP lectures are giving me confidence to solve language processing problems. He is accessible outside class hours and gives guidance to project all through the term., I liked this class. Professor wants you to learn practical skills with good examples from different articles. Exams like an interview task: given a dataset, you need to try diff models and produce results. He explain everything in a simple way , it is very easy to understand., Professor is always accessible outside of class, It was really a nice experience to get to learn from Professor Ali., It was a very nice learning experience. He included lot of on hands exercises, which provides a deeper insight into the subject., Gives good feedback, accessible outside class anytime, and amazing lectures., Great lectures!, Good, He is seriously the best <3, I like his teaching style, no pressure on students and hes so caring whenever you need help, hes available and just ping him on Slack. I was new in using Stack and now I like it. He explains Machine Learning in an easy-to-understand way. His focus is on our class projects that I like it because we can learn by doing ML projects in a team., I personally didnt like the teaching style at all, 80% of the class he focuses on slack(slack obsession) and medium articles and actually doesnt teach anything. Gives heavy home work, and then asks us to apply what we learned from homework on the project we are doing. Completely un organized!!I wouldnt suggest him.i didnt learn anything new-0%, Lot of learning and get ready for lot of work based on industry project., It was an awesome learning experience with Dr Arsanjani . I got to learn different aspect of of Machine Learning concepts. He was always available to clarify the doubts even outside the class. I am glad that we got the opportunity to learn from him., Great professor with good industrial experience in the field. His mentoring sessions are really helpful in getting the complete insights about the machine learning concepts and helped in better understanding of the use-case and solving them., Usage of practical examples or demo in class could help in understanding concepts., Dr Arsanjani is a nice professor. He provides hands-on assignments which is the right way of learning. The entire course was filled with a great learning experience. Definitely recommend his class., explains the complicated concepts clearly. knowledgeable instructor. learn a lot from Dr. Arsanjani, Dr. Arsanjani is an awesome instructor. He is very\xa0knowledgable and inspiring. He always encourages students, responsive, and communicates things in a clear way. His course material was really interesting, he ensured students to grasp most of the concepts. The assignments were challenging and it helped me learn a lot., Very practical approach in teaching.

Very motivating Class. Current edge technologies awareness., Great experience on having the class with Professor Ali, hes very knowledgeable and respectful to all of the students, always ready to answer any question in and after class., Quite disorganized with respect to assignment expectations, deadlines and even portals where they need to be submitted. Grading policy was not clear(you dont get scores for slack). Assignments lead to projects, even if you get full scores in assignments the same consolidated into project submission yields low score with no feedback from professor., Great Professor, Makes you do lots of machine learning exercises which is enough to clear your concept and practical on subject matter ! Recommended !!, Sets high expectations, tough for beginners. His industrial exposure greatly helps in understanding the concepts. Clear grading criteria, but does not provide feedback., He introduced us to real world examples of application of machine learning. This has been very useful., * Industry oriented learning rather than theoretical or maths for the Machine Learning course * Available to clarify doubts even outside the class, I gained a good understanding of not only applying ml algorithms but also understanding the overall story that algorithms are trying to explain. Having said that the class topics are not in flow and first topic is not related to the next. Also classes are little light on technical examples., Prof. Ali Arsanjani has helped to provide clear understanding of Machine Learning concepts., Great professor with deep experience in the field. I am really glad that we had the opportunity to learn from him this semester."
Cay Horstmann,/professor/78821,3.0,20%,3.9,"It was the first time that he taught CS 146 in the past Spring semester,2019. Exams were so hard. If you want to pass cs146, I dont recommend his class., This is his first time teaching so hes still rusty on data structures & algorithms. Uses Dr. Taylors system, although he tweaks it (i.e. midterms are spread out throughout semester and extends deadlines for assignments). Very open to questions and willing to help you out. Make sure you know every algorithm in and out! Youll be tested on that, He has the philosophy of student can read HIS book, so no lecture. Class time are labs that he doesnt grade, but expect u to do it as parts of them on exam. Lab rarely have all instruction needed. Lab solution? Have to copy as fast as he type. 90% grading done by script, pts off per test case(unknown till graded)fail. 1 time consuming HW per week., Vague! As someone on Piazza and here said. He literally does not describe in enough detail what he wants. Its one thing to ask students to research and not know all the answers. Its another to not provide enough HW info on WHAT. Only finished 2.5/5 questions on exam. Grades JavaDoc on EVERYTHING. Have to calc our grades from Github., the worst teacher in my life, he thinks the course is tougher and you learn more. he is smart but not good at teaching. If you have question, he wants you to post on Piazza., Didnt teach and just expect us know everything he wrote on his own book. All he wants is publishing his book and didnt come to class for 5 times now. PLZ save your college life by not taking him., Closer to a 3.5 than a 4. Easily the hardest CS class Ive taken at SJSU, difficulty is higher than both CS 146 and 155. Homework will take around 5 hours per assignment initially and will ramp up to 20ish per assignment. IF YOU DO TAKE THIS CLASS YOU WILL COME OUT FAR MORE CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND EXECUTE IN NEW LANGUAGES., Lowsy professor., Very good professor, I only have a recommend that adding more exams!! More exams can let us get better grades., He is super smart but does not teach effectively. It takes me hours to understand his assignments, you can never finish his tests ( miss atleast one big question). The only way to sanely pass with a B ish grade is do really good on the HWs which are often graded so weirdly. His grading rubric is designed so javadoc bring you down 20% on the hw., I didnt like him as a teacher overall. Theres a lot of things he needed to improve on as a teacher. However, I learned a lot in this course and it actually will help for 146. His grading system is very generous. I HIGHLY suggest you do VERY WELL in HW in this class. It will honestly save your grade. Also, this class is a LOT of work. So be ready., Since the class is almost 200 students, it is difficult to expect him to be there to help everyone. You need to self-study a lot of the materials in this class. For beginners, make sure you read the book before starting this class because it will be a big jump from CS 46A. However, I learned a lot from his class and his textbook., I dont recommend his class. As some other people said, he expected students to finish homework before his lecture. His homework is EXTREMELY challenging. Thats true the class is graded on curve. But there are some students who have experienced on programming, and even professional programmer from open college. So it is incredibly hard to get A., You will learn from him, BUT you will risk failing his class and probably one more of your other class, He is a tough professor for a beginner programmer. When he assigns homework, he sometimes gets really vague on what he wants done which can make the problems harder. Midterms are tough but, he curves it based on the result of the whole class. Its a hard class but at the same time, I felt like I learnt quite a lot from his class., He is one of the worst teacher I ever took. He assumes all students are pro in data structure. Literally you have to solve his assignment before prof starts giving lecture otherwise its really challenging to finished it. His homework in a week includes 2 quiz, and 3 programming assignment ( draft and final). If youre taking his class be aware!!!, Cay is a really great professor. He made sure to answer everyones questions on Piazza, which most professors do not do. His instructions for homework are vague, but he is always there to help so long as you ask. I feel as though his assignments were more practical than the other professors. I would highly recommend him!, The name of the class was Intro to Programming. There is nothing intro about this course. I\m talking 20-25 hours a week if you want an A, and that\s just on Homework and Labs, not including Studying. Instructions were often vague in a class where instructions are incredibly crucial. In all, I strongly do not recommend this class., DO NOT take his class if you are a first time programmer. It will be a living nightmare! He knows his stuff, but just is a very bad teacher who isnt clear in directions and on assignments., very disorganized. Directions for work are extremely vague and unhelpful. The code he uses for labs and homeworks is extremely buggy and rarely works the way he says. You are expected to know a lot of android development already, despite the pre-reqs being 46A and 47. Dont take this class unless you have tons of free time and experience!, very disorganized. Directions for work are extremely vague and unhelpful. The code he uses for labs and homeworks is extremely buggy and almost never works the way he says. You are expected to know a lot of android development already, despite the pre-reqs being 46A and 47. Dont take this class unless you have tons of free time and experience!, If you are a first time Java student, dont take him. If youre experienced in programming prior to the class, he should be easy. It was really hard for the first time programmers to grasp everything because he wasnt organized and a book that he wrote was too confusing., First few labs were dedicated to forcing his OS and text editor preferences on the students (lubuntu and emacs), its a waste of class time that could be spent learning the actual material. He knows enough about Java to teach, but there isnt much beyond that and his OS politics (like its 1995)., Hes a pretty good teacher, You dont have to go to class, but you have to participate during class which can be done at home. The class is easy as long as you do all HW and labs without cheating. Basically if you can stay on a computer for long periods of time, and your logical, (the basics of a CS major) then you pass the class with flying colors., 2 out of class, open book online quizzes each week.\n Long hard exams, generously curved. 3 challenging hws weekly. Concise lectures with multiple clicker questions. Labs after class. Employs every conceivable tactic to get u to think, learn. Lots of snafus. A bumpy, painful, stressful, fantastic learning experience!, I went in with an open mind, and tried to like this prof. But he is not well prepared and unorganized. I have to check EVERY hw, and quiz for grading mistakes, I find them often. His exams have egregious mistakes, and are poorly run. His attitude is not defensive, but he is never apologetic. Clearly 46B is low priority for him. Very disappointing., It is obvious that in his mind he knows the material, but he is the most disorganized professor I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach, and his slides are completely useless. I did not learn one thing in his course, and it was a complete waste of money. Dont take his class if you want to learn., He knows what hes talking about, which is also his downfall teaching. He teaches like everyone knows what hes talking about even if they dont. Asking him questions doesnt really help either. Do the homework and practice a lot. He assigns the homework before he explains the material. Not good for first time Java learners., At first, I thought his class was good. However, it turned out to be stressful because we are having labs two days a week. There are no demonstrations about showing how a class is formed., DO good on the Hw like 80 percent, get a C and Ds on the Exams. Get a like B on the group  project you pass the class. Try your best dont quit.!!!! Be active Participate!! Try to learn! Go to class/labs even though its waste of time. TRYYYYYYYY TO LEARN., He wrote the book the class is based on and thinks that his book is so good he does not need to teach/lecture or help at all. His HW is strait from the book and is fairly challenging and only gets harder. Being in class is the worst thou because he does not teach a word and expects us to know the material perfectly. Highly Not Recommend., Would not recommend this teacher for first time java students. He doesnt teach anything in class. He expects students to learn by reading his textbook. Helps students if they have questions but doesnt go over a single homework problem in class, which are very hard., Not Really Helpful. Not a recommended Professor for students learning java for the first time. Does not explain anything in class, very little. Doesnt go over the homework problems in class. Expects students to learn by reading the text book, which is written by him. IF you dont understand him then you wont under stand the textbook. :), Overall he\s a decent teacher if you ask him with specific questions for help. Sometimes he can be really confusing because he doesn\t really explain unless you know what you dont know (odd right?) Don\t expect to learn through lectures, but expect to learn through the labs., You need to work really hard for this subject. Grades exactly as you have worked. Responds to email as quick as he can. But be sure to ask him sensible questions. No group homework. So dont rely on other people., Smart guy and funny too.  Only problem is that he gives way too much work.  Expect to spend several days on his HW assignments.  His exams are hard but he curves., Cay Horstmann is the James Bond of Computer Science., Professor Horstmann is the ONLY reason I choose SJSU CS vs others. What he taught still echos in my daily life as a software engineer. By taking his class I achieved more than I could have been without it. Look beyond the textbooks, guys...., Cay Horstmann is arguably the rock star professor for the CS department, and with good reason.  His command of the material is particularly impressive and he knows how to draw material together nicely.  This particular 185C section was on open-source software and is highly recommended., Pure genius. Horstmann is the guru of CS. If you want to succeed in the real world, this is the professor to take., The class is too hard compared to the alternatives. Unlike what the previous person said, his class is not close to real work environment, so this should not be a reason to take his class. He is a good teacher but he seems to assume that this is the only class you take and loads you accordingly. Take Tseng., His 160 class is about as close to the real-world work environment experience as you are ever going to get in a school setting.  If you have no prior work exp in s/w dev, the practical skills and experience youll gain in the class are well worth the effort you are bound to put into it., Expects you to check e-mail and online green sheet daily as hell change due dates or change the assignment without telling you in class. Lectures use same examples as book which arent the greatest. Slides are the same as in the book no help there. Easy grader. Curves. Download source code for his book from his website., One of the BEST CS prof there is at SJSU.  His exams and projects are never easy, but his lectures are plain great--straight to the point and easy to understand.  You will learn loads in his class., lots of programming assignments and expects a lot from students., Dr. Horstmann is awesome. Very well organized, and concise lecture. You can learn essence of CS like refactoring, automation, unit testing and design pattern. I have also taken CS152 with him. Those classes have brought me into next level. I even got a full-time Software engineer job right after the classes. I would love to take him with again....., This professor is awesome. His lectures are very concise. He has a sense of humor too. I wish there were more professors like him at SJSU. If you just want to pass the class, take Lees and speak Chinese with him. LOL, If you really like programming, take his class. If you dont like coding, avoid him by all means.He is the best and toughest guy in CS dept., I did learn alot when I was in his class., Expect to spend 20+ hours a week on homework for this class.  Youll have an assignment due every two weeks, and each will take about 40-50 hours to code.  That being said, great teacher!  Very well organized, very clear.  The textbook for the course is o, Hard homework and midterm, but both are fair enough for this class. Interesting class, you will learn a lot from him., You HAVE to take 151 from this guy. I mean, he *wrote the book* on java. Good organization of lectures, clear explanation of complex topics. Hard homeworks, easy midterms., Learn a lot in his class.  Great teacher, Probably the most educated and well trained CS teacher at SJSU. overall good, Homework is easy, but time consuming. Midterms are extremelly difficult., bad, hard midterms"
Renee Fecteau,/professor/4455,3.7,100%,3.2,"She is really cool! And I loved taking her CS class but it was a bit boring., Chicken scratch handwriting and a thick accent, I couldnt even follow her to save my life!  She is one of the reasons I dropped out of CS!, took her unix class. she is a great teacher and her test is fair., I dropped out of SJSU because of her. Not only she doesnt know how to teach, she will literally demolish your interest/confidence/life in CS with her harsh coursework and grading. I can expect this kind of workload in an UC campus, not in MacQuarrie Hall., She had clear, precise, and organized notes. Always prepared for class. Very presentable and clean cut. She is tough, but fair. I learned more in her than posibbly all of my classes put together. I took her for CS147 as well. I LOVE HER!!!!!, She sucked., Pretty ****y when it comes to being critical about programs and test questsions, but she knows what shes talking about. I probably could have done a lot better if I didnt have the class right after 3 hours of Humanities., She is a very good teacher., FECTEAU IS FREAKIN AWESOME.. too bad shes retiring =(, Yeah, shes a little quirky (overly dramatic), but I prefer that over the boring droning typical to a comp sci prof. She knows her stuff; class doesnt require you to read extra info from a text because there is no textbook, just class notes/handouts. Recommended. Assignments are straightforward., GOd this Teacher is a B****!!! She is mean, and not helpful at all! If you go to her office hours, she will find some reason to yell at you so you dont even feel comfortable asking a question! shez so unfair! gradez bad! Old crank! shouldnt even be teaching! Get lost you oldie!, She is a good professor. At least, she knows how to program. A lot of professors at SJSU do not know how to program. I cannot believe., As a teacher she is good but as a person ... Not a nice one to talk to., She is one of the best. Good and clear examples. Her notes are very organized and you will learn a lot in her classes., Highly recommended, Great teacher! Gave good examples and taught exactly what she tested on., excellent teacher for CS 140 which sets the foundation for CS 147 . i began to love assembly programming after learning with her . very systematic, great class notes , exams that challenge you without killing you . You need to study regularly though else you can slip your grade ., one of the best instructors i ever had at sjsu. and i didnt have many. smart person, fair and super fast in grading, and very clear on lecture. listen to the lecture and ull get A. the other ****s who did bad it was becuz they suck. shes not hard at all, but if ur dumb or lazy, dont take her., Fair teacher! Hard class, but she explains things well! Doesnt expect things she didnt teach. Definitely recommended!!!, grades harshly. made a girl cry. NOT recommended., She is a nice teacher and will help you with any problems you might have on the subject.  Only one large programming assignment and tests.  The tests themselves were about average and her lecturing skills are somewhat bland as well., Hard teacher who doesnt teach well -_-, She has no people skills so dont bother asking questions, she gives you whatever grade she wants.  She is below average as a lecturer, tests are mediocre, acts insulted by students that she has to teach an intro class., Mean., She gives you such a great foundation in java programming that i had easier times in my other classes.  By far one of the greatest teachers Ive had so far.  Heard shes not coming back next semester.  Its so unfortunate to lose one of the good teachers., She could come across as rude at times which might deter some students from approaching her for help, but shes actually really helpful during office hrs and she really cares about doing everything she can to teach the material the best way possible., excellent teacher, Im not an easy guy to motivate into doing work, but she does that easily. She teaches in an interesting manner that you will find both informative and helpful as a CS student. Very clear with her lectures and what she expects from you., Very clear on what needs to be done. Very helpful website with leacture notes that will save your life., I have taken 2 classes with her. She was horrible but has gotten better on the 2nd class. Her teaching material is great and grading seems pretty fair. However, i think she is rude and unapproachable becuz of her moodiness., Horrible teacher, She was a great teacher.  Her assignments will make you learn a lot and she has an interesting attitude. Keep up on the assignments and the tests will be easy and youll get an A., She is amzing!I just feel so glad that I took this course under her.Her course is really organized and well prepared.Even her assignments build on what she teaches in class.She is excellent!, If you want to learn, take this teacher!  Shes great and her programs are challenging but it pays off for CS majors.  Take her class!, Unfair.. Very frustated., HARD, Well organized online notes, though she didnt spend much time on lecture in classroom. You can learn very well by practicing those hands-ons from her website. Remember to do all the assigment, tests and exam are fair., Clear lecture and notes, very interesting intonation. She explains deeply for those important and hard concepts of programming. Fair exams, acceptable program assignment. Good professor over all. If you really want to learn, take her!, No good.  Yells at students when they ask questions.  Has no people skills at all.  She gets frustrated when students dont understand concepts., A lot of hard programming assignment and homework...picky person..hard n strict marking test...not free during office hour...talk lots of non sense about C programming while teaching Java ...stupid idiot !, Shes a great prof. Her notes are awesome and very well organized. You dont really need to get the book., She is tough, but knows the material very well. She goes through the material fast so it is absolutely imperative that you go to her class every day., A good teacher., Great knowledge . Knows her subject very well and in a clear fashion . Very systematic . Very picky about small things like the correct submission folder and correct comments ., Clear lecture. Prepare to learn a lot. Picky about program structure., clear lectures, not so picky about programs as long as it runs correctly, Good teacher, but prepare to work hard., Assembler tests very hard; Grades programs very strictly, Very helpfule during office hours. Clear lecture"
Fabio Di Troia,/professor/2116397,4.2,86%,3.1,"Probably one of the best CS professors Ive ever had. Hes a really caring professor and gives every student equal amounts of time they need in office hours. If you are scared of Machine Learning and learning it, he makes it very easy to understand. He emphasizes understanding the process rather than memorizing, which makes the subject approachable, (25% each) 2 MT, 1 Final, HW. Content itself was very conceptual. Just ask the right questions to understand protocols thoroughly & the rest isnt difficult. Highly recommend attending lecture, he records but examples on board arent shown. Prof is probably the nicest/most fun Ive had, very approachable for help. Also gave EC to help students out., Awesome professor. You dont need to find online videos to understand concepts, his lecture and notes are good enough to excel exams. Attendance is not mandatory but recommended. Gives extra credit if class average is low. Exams carry high weight for overall grade., All-around fantastic professor! Lectures well at a decent pace and is always willing to help. Material wasnt hard to understand except for HMM maybe. Never felt overwhelmed with the workload for this class. Midterms and final were in the form of projects. Really appreciated that he had 1-1 office hours instead of lectures during midterm weeks., The material we learned was very hard, but Fabio did a great job simplifying it for us. Always checked to see if we understood what was going on. Workload was VERY manageable (4 HW, 2 midterm projects, final project). Usually ended class 5-10 min early which was nice. Recorded lectures too. I only wish he had clear grading rubrics for projects tho., He goes over the material with nice pacing. As long as you attend all lectures, which do not feel boring at all, you should be able to easily pass the class. If you want to score high grades, you do need to actively participate (ask questions) when its necessary. The tests are completely relevant to what is covered in lecture., Fabios great! Knowledgable and very responsive to questions. It was a pleasure to work with him., Great class! More emphasis on safe/good programming conventions than on getting correct output. Fairly easy assignments that help with midterms and final, which are projects. Very helpful in office hours and will help debug your code. Records lectures and lets class out 15 min early. I only wish he had clear grading rubrics on Canvas though., Amazing! Clear/concise lectures that are recorded so you can watch them later. Very responsive to questions and ends class 15 min early! 6 HWs in the form of a Canvas quiz with unlimited time. Open note exams with a few tricky questions. He curves exam grades though and also shares last semesters exams so we know what kinds of questions to expect., Fabio is very knowledgeable about information security and always there to help students. His lectures are well-prepared, very easy to follow, fun and enjoyable., Cant teach basic concepts. Rushes a lot and skip over important material. The most important part is left to the student :) AVOID, The concepts taught are pretty tough, but Fabio offers plenty of support both in and out of class: responsive to questions and emails, approachable, and friendly. Exams are of moderate difficulty. Occasional exam curves. Generous extra credit., Loved him! Super chill, a great sense of humor, and very responsive to emails. Two midterms and a final, all of which are projects., Very unclear in explaining the topic. Does not answer clearly to emails either. Nice guy though, but cant teach, Professor Fabio was super nice, super knowledgeable, very lenient, and his primary focus was helping students learn and understand instead of punish through grades. I loved how his lectures were engaging and he incorporated humor to keep everyone interested, his assignments were directly relevant to what we were learning, So you know, this class is a project-based class and half the class is asynchronous. - Kinda straightforward lectures, but with many pauses - slow at grading but lenient enough - receive a course grade but when he did not post our final project scores. MUST know python (with sklearn) before taking ML. pros: 1-hr lecture, turns out to be good., Professor Di Troia is amazing. His lectures are very engaging and informative. I thoroughly enjoyed his InfoSec class. It was not an easy class, and you have to work for it, but it is highly interesting and rewarding., Avoid, Helpful class. He shared lots of conventions and good habits for web servers and coding in general. Easy assignments but enhance what he taught in class. They help tremendously in midterm and final projects. Can put on resume something from this class. Wish SJSU have more web classes, not just backend just frontend too., I mean if you have to check Fabios reviews on RMP to look for opinions, are you even a CS student at SJSU? No doubt best CS prof at SJSU. Very knowledgable, hands out amazing lectures, shares lots of tips and interesting stories related to InfoSec. But there are so many students competing for questions and help so dont take this class alone., HES SO NICE. Theres no midterm / finals exams, just projects (and he was super lenient with extending their due dates when asked). He keeps his lectures interesting, is pretty fun, and is overall great. Tough class but awesome guy :), Fabio is very understanding with everybodys time and grade but do not go into this class expecting an easy A. This class is mostly project-based and Fabio does not hold your hand on projects. The assigned projects are at a level you would expect of master students. StackOverflow will not help you with this class, you need to be able to code well., Not recommended at all!, Horrible, avoid him at all costs. he has no regards for students. Dos not answer email to clarify questions. He can not teach, The worse instructor Ive ever had!!! He doesnt check his emails on purpose and when you ask him about answers and grades after 3 weeks, he has no reason to provide. He is just giving grades emotionally!! He doesnt even know how to answer some questions! Honestly you will learn nothing from his lectures because he is not a lecturer!, I LOVE Fabio, but for some reason, he stopped answering emails for 185C students asking for clarification by email. I took him for 166 also & hes AMAZING. There was just so much crammed into this class (ML, AI, HMM, SVM, KNN) that many of us got lost. His lectures are INCREDIBLE, learned a lot, but way too much content and huge final/MT projects., One of my fav CS classes Ive ever taken. His grading criteria are clear and he basically gives you all the info in the slides. Hes funny and lets us out 15 mins early every lecture without making you feel like you didnt learn anything., Really enjoyed taking his class, He does a great job of explaining things in class, so be sure to attend when you can, as hell also skip over some stuff on the slides. A couple of homework assignments (easy Canvas quizzes), but grade is mostly based on the 2 midterms and final., I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR. HONESTLY!!! THE BEST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD!! I took another one of his course (CS166) the following semester and even started working for him. I absolutely recommend this professor to any student (grad/undergrad). His lectures are very interesting and on to the point. I love how he uses his time wisely., This class is not easy to begin with. Basically learning how to code medium projects. 2 group midterm projects and solo final project. Weekly homework assignments, most are easy, just need a day to finish. Tough midterms and final tho, especially when you work with clowns. Fabio is hella smart, chill guy and everyone loves him. Take his class!, The professor is one of the coolest in the CS dept. I took this as a graduate elective, and keep wishing that I could take more classes with him! Lectures are easy and final projects are interesting, where you choose your level but hell grade fairly. He is focused on security of web applications, and gets you interested in it too., The class is graded in 4 sections of 25% each, so really make sure you dont mess up on the midterms or miss a hw. Fabio is a security expert in explaining the concepts; I personally found the class pretty confusing if you dont go, so I highly recommend it. Midterms and final are all online. Class was pretty interesting material. Amazing professor, Super chill guy, good sense of humor. Material is very straight forward and for the class project you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want and he will grade it fairly. This is an awesome elective choice and can either be an easy A (if you decide to pick an easy project) or an awesome resume builder if you pick a harder project., Fabio is a legend., This is one of the most difficult major class for computer science and believe me this guy would try his best to make the subject as easy as possible for you guys. You have to study but overall the professor is amazing., He is one of the best professors I have encountered in my classes at SJSU. He is really helpful and willing to make students learn the subject. I have taken 2 other classes with him and the response from those are the same. The projects he assigns each semester are really worth working for to show off on your resume., Extra credit helps a lot, Fabio cares about his students. If you ask for help, he will get back to you asap. Many complained about the exam being too hard though. Records his own lectures to youtube if you ask him to. I want to take him for every class I can now. His grading criteria can be a bit unclear though, and a small deduction can drop your grade quite a bit., Professor Fabio is one of the best professors I have taken a course with at San Jose State. He teaches really well and explains all of the important information to the students. His slides contain all the information you will need and are very thorough. I would definitely take another class with him., Fabio is pretty smart and fun to listen to, always backs up for clarification when needed. Will sometimes boost everyones test scores if class average is below passing. Very little work, however every point counts if you want an A. Tests are sometimes graded oddly (3 points for a multiple choice, vs 2 for short answer) so be careful., Laid back, very knowledgeable. Wants people to pass his class. Good slides. He keeps lectures short and sweet., I took his 152 in Spring 2016. I really recommend everyone to take his class. 1. He replies emails really fast. 2. Lecture is short but detailed. 3. HWs/Tests are not difficult and he gave extra points Note: for the extra points, they count directly into final grade. In my case, I only need to have 30/100 for my final to get an A at the end...., Didnt learn anything from the teacher. Had to call him on some errors in his tests, and what is good practice and not. Still dont know anything more about this topic than I did going into the class. He is there to help after his 30min lecture, but google is better However, the tests are easy and fair. An easy A class if you review slides and hw., 30 mins lecture. Attendance is not mandatory.  No programming assignments. You will have multiple HW assignments on canvas usually 10 questions out of which 7 are multiple choice and 3 are short answers with unlimited time. There will be tests that are timed. If you read the slides and attend lecture, you will be fine., Best I have ever had! For this class, everything goes with the slides, study it means passing the class. He is nice and always accessible. He is willing to answer your question. He even helped me with stuff from my other class. The grading is fair enough.  I would definitely take him again if have the chance!, Great teacher. Keeps his lectures short and uses the time after lecture for questions. The homework can be a bit tricky if you dont attend the lecture. If you study the slides well enough though you will do fine. His tests are based upon his homework assignments and the slides. The final was very straight forward and fair. Great teacher., Lectures are fairly vague and always ended about 30 minutes early (good bc less time spent at lecture and bad bc it wasnt engaging enough and were fast-paced). Never found his lectures helpful bc the material is straightforward if you read book and slides. Gave canvas hw and likely accessible for 1-on-1 help when needed., For most questions you get the answer Don\t worry. Tests are all based on his slides, no book needed."
Chris Tseng,/professor/213630,2.3,40%,3.1,"Professor Tseng is a nice dude. Generally speaking, the course itself is not terribly difficult to survive through. Just do the work, have a good group for the group project, and you should be okay. These other reviews seem pretty accurate in terms of what the course layout is like and the final project. Pretty chill overall, no complaints from me., 1st half of the semester, he lectures on project management, agile/scrum, etc. with easy weekly hw. Second half is team project which is using a CMS to build a website. He doesnt grade anything as other teams grade your project milestones and TA grades hw and final milestone. Project EC is determined by participation in your teams discord server., The class is supposed to be software project, but he teaches scrum and agile for the first half of the semester and then gives a useless tool to make a website that a 5 year old could do as well. Doesnt grade anything himself, the other groups grade you. Midterm and final are mcq, but they are super confusing and super difficult to get good marks., The professors instructions are vague. He gives assignments that could have several correct answers but only gives you a good grade if they are answers that he likes. This class is like hoping to learn to drive by just reading the DMV handbook without ever driving. You wont learn to be a better software engineer from learning the material., Material is good, but professor is monotone and makes it very difficult to listen in class. Goes on random tangents which makes it hard to follow the lecture. Grading is very unclear, we were graded on participation for group project and it seem like it was determined based on how many messages you wrote on your groups discord server... Very picky, His lectures are pointless. He goes over a lot of topics but, those topics feel like busy work. His assignments are easy. Dont expect to learn much from this class. The project is about making a dynamic website but, we are not really making a website. We use a tool called Drupal that does all the work. We just provide the content of the website., Its weird. The first part of the semester, youre just learning about some vague stuff on software development stages. Therre will be a couple homework assignments that are easy. But the problem is the group project. The project is about making dynamic website, yet we never learn about how to make one. Lecture is random rambling on CS151 topic., Professor Tseng gives great feedback. You will have homework every week but if you pay attention in class, you will get a 100/100 easily. There is 1 mid term and 1 final and a group project. Lectures are recorded and are available the entire semester. He is a very good grader so dont worry about grades., Good material, bad explanation. Hes really hard to understand, partially because of his English, but mostly due to the way the explain things. He jumps from one point to another in the code (using search terms), making it impossible to follow the logic. Doesnt really give feedback to what youre doing wrong., Took him over winter session for 46a, overall the class was very fast paced but he tried to catch us up whenever possible. He did not always explain information to the fullest but he did provide links for us to read later on. He also put a high emphasis on certain topics (sometimes telling us what would be on the exams) to assist the students., He read slides to us about agile and program management. Does a couple of online classes with HTML and JSON. But 2/3 of the class is the projects, and his grading rubric is the stupidest thing ever. Its based on what the other group rated you as and what your peer grade you as. The FINAL PROJECT is 30% of your grade (everyone got 90-100). Stresful, Dont take him for 160 or 174 unless youre taking a 1-class semester for some reason. His project has confusing directions and will overlap with finals week to make both his class and other classes harder to pass., Unhelpful tbh. He expects you to know the material by heart. Within 2 weeks he covered 6 chapters!!! Don\t take him, his hw assignments are nerve wracking, plus the TA grades unfairly. His guidelines for the class project are extremely vague, more than half the time I\m confused about what to do. I woulda taken someone else if available., Do the homework and your final project as those two are the biggest parts of your grade. His tests are tricky, but you can always make up the points by doing bonus homework assignment. Final group project for CS161 is the biggest factor of your grade and beware of choosing partners because you cant change them. Overall the class it tolerable., Huge emphasis on a group project.  Professor was rude and degrading.  He argued with the group in front of the class and interrupted us on several occasions.  He told us we needed to be better without providing any feedback on how.  A third party reviewed our project in class and loved it.  Professor told us to fix it with no direction., It is interesting class. But, class subject and project is hard. Grading was ok, but you might need to study hard!, I am skeptical if he even knows how to program. He doesnt actually teach anything in his class and just throw projects at you. He has a huge ego and a bad accent, its very hard to stay awake in his class. But if you do all the work... youll pass the class whilst learning nothing., This guy in intolerable. Most irritating professor of SJSU & always blame students for his mistake. Keeps forgetting about what he has to teach in class. Complete package of TimePass. Arrogant, Irritating, unbearable, dumb professor of SJSU & should be sacked for wasting students money on his course., Worst worst worst ... n times. No clarity at all. Directs frustration on students. Dnt waste your time and money all. I dont understand why SJSU has such useless professors., Worst professor I have evern seen in my entire life. No Clarity at all. always confused. alway threatens to fail, Despite its name Big data analytics the course did not touch on big data at all. We spoke of XML and JSON and reviewed commercial software for log analysis. We did NOT discuss anything even closely related to big data such as sharding strategies and map-reduce., This guy is abusive. He often threatens to take off 25-50% of your all your points for things he did not specify (e.g. EXACT naming convention) or are outside of your control (HIS server not accepting file uploads for half the time between work assigned and due). He doesnt put effort in the class and directs his frustration at students., If you want to learn something relevant please avoid this class. 50% of material is already covered in CS151(prereq). Lectures are as boring as they get. He seems to be unable to present material without using his slides (Thanks I can read slides myself). Homework is designed for special ed students. Uninspiring, utterly boring and insulting., 1st half of semester were fed mindless and useless homework. 2nd part of semester is focused on team project. Descriptions of project assignments are vague. Book is almost unused. Only 4 chapters were covered. Grading is questionable. Meet 1 day a week + 3 furloughs (total 15 meetings). Easy class, but very little value. Avoid at all costs., His class is alright. As long as you do the work and is a good contributor to your group, you should be good. Watch out for group members that dont do anything. Youll have to pick up the slack from them because he makes the class like real world work. One midterm, so do good on that. Majority of hw is doing reports, which he is really big on., cryptic grading scheme that relies on what you do wrong rather then what you did right. If your answer is not his answer (on open ended questions) you get half credit even if you back up your claims. The final project is about as worthless as they come, where the bulk of the work is in the report, not your project. Easiest 160 class, waste of time., This is the professor to take for CS160. The first few months is really easy, made up of straight-forward homework and quizes. But the group project in the final month will make up for it. He was very clear, and explained things well, sometimes making it feel like a lower division class. I ended up using alot of the PHP/SQL programming later on., This class is pretty chill except for the last month where you have to do a group project. Just make sure you have good ppl in your group or you are screwed. Luckily, there is no final, just a midterm. He is a nice guy and shows concern for students. He gives loads of extra credit, especially for the midterm. Overall a great prof and fun class., Very good and helpful teacher. There was plenty of work, including the final project, but it was all directly related to the class material and was very helpful in learning the web stuff., Nice professor, learned a lot about PHP and web design.  Final project was a lot of work.  Is very helpful during office hours and a lenient/understanding grader..i say understanding because we had a very hard grader, but he would give points back when u make the case to him. Overall good professor., He does not know much about programming. His programming skill is suck. But some of CS professors at SJSU are like him.Suck at programming.Always talk about old stuff which they learn at their school. What is CS?, This was the most interesting class of Computer Science. The web application project was very fun to do and an interesting subject to learn which is relevant to todays web applications. Professor Tseng did an excellent job of teaching this class., easy material to study. Project are very userful, however too much pressure. Hes very responsive to all the questions (I got back his answer from email really fast). I learn a lot in his class, No Comments, The worst Prof. He has no clue abt his presence. I wish i could revert back and take another course. Didnot learn a thing.Not a fair grader., He know nothing about programming. His interest is focused on some old, odd, and useless stuff. He never express his idea clearly to me and he is never fair in grading., Great teacher who cares about students knowledges and questions. More pressure on the final exam (2 weeks), but training you in future real work. I started from bare knowledge of HTML,PHP,Apache and MySQL into profiency level just thru this class-Fall 02, Doesnt know anything. Will make u work like crazy on stuff that doesnt make sense. Will be partial in grading scheme. Slippery like an eel. Will slip through even then. This is coming from a 3.7 GPA student. You can still take his class if you wish..."
Dominic Abucejo,/professor/1969051,3.9,77%,2.4,"Great guy, would recommend everyone to take his class. Super knowledgeable in software practices in industry. Hes super chill and as long as you do the work you will get a good grade., CS160 depends on your project, a large chunk of your grade is the term project. Outside of the term project, the midterms and homeworks are very manageable., I took him in-person for 49J. He is very caring and gives 2 in-class activities per week and some assignments too (Zybooks + Canvas). Some quizzes but theyre easy. Midterms and final are on computer (canvas) but in-person. Open notes and homework. Gives extra time for assignments if you ask for help on time., Dominic is a great person who is very flexible with his assignments. If you are struggling, he will help you and even give you more time if necessary. Assignments and course material coincide with exams, so you are tested on what you learn. However, he is a bit disorganized and pushed one of the midterms back three times. Otherwise a good prof., Nice guy. Very easy class. A tad disorganized., Good professor! The class is really chill. He even moved the due dates for assignments a lot of times for us. Exams are easy as well. Though it was advanced C++, the class was much easier than I thought. Take him!, He is a very nice guy, but seemed kind of disorganized. Also took a long time to grade things. The difficulty of quizzes, assignments, etc. felt fair from what was taught in lectures, there were no curveballs. Extended deadlines for several things. Overall, not a bad choice., This course doesn\t really live up to its name Advanced C++. It\s more like Intermediate C++ with a touch of data structures and stuff., He grades nicely but doesnt teach the concepts well. The lecture is just slides and him explaining some code which tends to get boring. You will have to do some studying outside to really understand the concepts. The homework are past assignments from about 4 years ago which you can find online. Overall, a decent professor for an easy grade., Nice guy, I enjoyed this class and honestly didnt find it very hard. He does a decent job of explaining things and was generous when it came to extending deadlines for homework and projects for students that needed the extra time. The only real problem is that sometimes his directions are confusing., Hes really nice but is not a great lecturer, take this class if you want an easy A but dont expect to fully learn any of the concepts. You will have to do a lot of self studying to reinforce what he briefly goes over in class., Nice prof, curved one exam and extended a project deadline. He does lectures, but they are really boring, hard to stay awake. Hws and labs are where the learning happens. TB reading is not required but can be helpful. Overall not a difficult class if you are patient and can self study, Lectures are boring. Not very good at teaching. Sometimes the concepts were taught wrong. I had to attend another professors lecture to actually understand the concepts. The exams were just code where we had to WRITE CODE on PAPER., He is very helpful in terms of really wanting you to learn programming. Explains the concepts well, even to people with zero background in programming at all. This is an entry level class so he definitely gives new student a good foundation to build on in computer science/programming., Very good professor. His lectures are precise, clear and you actually learn new things along the way. Pay attention, learn, enjoy the process and youll get an A. He brings industry experience into the class, which really helps to focus learning into not only gain a strong foundation of java programming but also toward practical job usage., Mr. Abucejo is a great prof. He presents lecture notes via projector and takes the time to explain each slide carefully. He often wrote code on the whiteboard to explain the topics we were learning. He was very generous with partial credit on both midterms and was easy to get a hold of through email. His office hours were really helpful too!, He was too nice. This class was very easy for me because his final exam was open book. Ive never taken higher CS classes with him before, but if hes also being that nice in those classes, people wont learn much. CS is supposedly a tough course, and its not helpful to have easy CS classes especially if you want to be a software developer."
Thomas Austin,/professor/2000580,4.8,100%,3.6,"Austin is one of the best profs Ive had at SJSU, especially for 152. The class has a lot of doable labs, some fun HW, and a 2-person project which got difficult towards the end. He grades incredibly leniently on exams so you cant fail if you study the material. If you want to both learn and pass 152, take Professor Austin- you will not regret it!, Hes a very chill professor. Good majority of the class focuses on Haskell and while it is not my favorite language to work with, he gives many examples and is very approachable in office hours. One midterm and one final and there are no curve balls on the exam., Lots of labs, 1 for every class, 4 HWs, 1 project, 1 midterm and final, gives practice exam for both. Amazing lectures, worth it to go in person although attendance not mandatory. Learn lots of languages: Scheme, JS, Prolog, Ruby, ANTLR, Latex, Inform 7, Solidity, Rust. Grades leniently on exams, attempt everything. Overall, would recommend, Learned a LOT of programming langs. Responsive to students questions and always willing to help. Class is a lot of work: labs, HW, project, midterm, final. Grades leniently on exams. Talks fast so with the mask on, it was hard to understand him at times. Wish he knew more about Windows PC: had a major issue w/ the project, but he couldnt help me., Professor Austin is one of the the best professors at SJSU. I really enjoyed his class and learned so many different languages including Scheme, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, LaTex, and more! There are labs for every class but they are very doable. Definitely recommend for CS152!, Probably one of the best classes Ive taken at SJSU! He has gone over many languages during the semester and taught the material well. Despite the COVID status, hes been very helpful with office hours overall. Wish he thought other courses..., LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!!! HE IS HONESTLY ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS IVE HAD! I didnt know a thing about Haskell but after taking his course, I became quite confident in using it. His daily assignments kept me on track through-out the semester. The mid-term and final exam was a bit tough but its totally doable if you did your assignments., Friendly professor, good sense of humor and lecturer but dont be fooled this class is a lot of work. 2-3 labs per week, regular homeworks and a semester project ontop of exams. It can feel more like a 4 unit class at times. Try not to pair with other difficult CS classes if you dont want a stressful semester. Dont miss lectures!, This is a fast paced class with assignments being given on a regular basis. However, he will give you full credit for each lab as long as you show him that you tried. Learn Racket, JS, Prolog, Ruby, and a few other minor languages. All tests and homework are reasonable. Very approachable outside class and via email. Cant really say a bad word., Learned a lot of cool(and some not so cool) languages in this class. Austin is a great lecturer and definitely one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU., Learned Ruby, Scheme, Prolog, JavaScript. Great teacher, fair grader. No surprises on exams. Labs, homework and projects are simple but may take a lot of time. Very approachable., I learned so many programming languages taking this class. The professor is really smart and helpful. Scheme was the most challenges to for me. You will learn Ruby, Python, JS, C, Prolog, Rust, LaTex, and more. The course moved super fast. You need to catch up with the material. Dont miss a class!, Very nice and friendly professor. He gives you credit for every lab as long as you turn something in. He gives 50-75% for homework as long as you turn in something to show you tried. Very lenient on midterm and final, AND CURVES IT! And at the end of the semester curves the class. Hes extremely smart and great examples, but I didnt have time., Up to date with computer science field and shows an expansive knowledge of various languages. All readings are online supplements, helpful. Great lectures and will be more than happy to explain anything. Labs are useful and graded on participation, but will dictate how much you learn in the class. Fair exams. Strong knowledge of pop culture., Hes like a poster boy for effective modern teaching. Charismatic and respectful. Brisk lectures, good oration. Lecture material, textbook, homework and exams all complement each other nicely. Material was new and challenging, delivered at a good pace. Friendly, accessible in and after class and office hours. Good-humoured, hip to the latest memes., Great professor. You have labs to do, but as long as you try, he will give you a checkmark. Has a review day for all the material on the midterm. Make sure you study for the midterm. He is a lenient grader for the test because he gives you points for just answering the problems. If you do the homework, you should be fine. Didnt really use the book"
Rula Khayrallah,/professor/2208638,4.3,79%,3.5,"Lectures are clear! Exams are fair and relevant to lectures, allows cheatsheets. Exams arent cumulative. Weekly 1 question quizzes but are easy if you pay attention in class. Homework assignments are done in pairs. Highly recommend., Attend class and listen to her. Make sure you know how to do all the iClicker questions and attend the review session. There are no curveballs on the exams and youll only do poorly if you dont read the questions carefully., One of the kindest professors Ive had at SJSU. Super caring and is always willing to help. In class participation activities help to reinforce learning. Looking forward to having future classes with her! Thank you professor!, She has a motherly charm and truly cares about her students. Her lectures are amazing to me despite some comments saying theyre boring. iClicker ensures youre actively participating the class. She is knowledgeable and tries to answer questions as much as time permits. Exams arent crazy hard, but grading is strict considering you dont have IDE., Labs/Quizzes constantly done in class so you need to show up. Rula is a nice professor who is very knowledgeable about Python. Homeworks are mostly done in groups of 2 (can be done individually if you want). Posts helpful lecture notes on Canvas., A lot of material will be covered but very helpful slides and labs will be provided. Homeworks are graded pretty harshly (Has to be exactly how she wants it even if you have correct results. Rubric is provided). Exams are very fair. Try your best to keep up with material or else you are going to have a lot to catch up on once exams come around., If I had to describe Prof. Khayrallah\s class in one word, it\d be fair. She\s meticulous when giving feedback on assignments, accessible outside of class, and super friendly--gives off that mom vibe. The only thing I could complain about is how quick the pace is, but that\s more a symptom of the class content itself rather than her., She is a very hard professor. What she teaches in class is simple, but the homework and exam is extremely hard. I wont recommend you take it unless u want to be an AI expert. Seriously!, The material is great, but she made it boring. The way she presents the lecture is too formal, teachers are supposed to be a better alternative to a textbook or slides so you can understand in a simple way, it comes naturally to anyone who knows exactly what theyre talking about. Unless you like that type of class, I suggest someone else., Shes a fairly nice professor and wants you to succeed, but her exams can be pretty tough and theres a lot of material/concepts to remember. Definitely go to her office hours, start on the homeworks early, and study a lot., Take Rula for CS 152. Her slides are simple and concise. She lets you have 1 page cheat sheet for her midterms and final. For her exams, make sure you understand the material really well and that you can program in the languages you learned in this class. Answering exam questions can be tough if you dont understand her lectures or do great on HW., Very fantastic professor. Goes through the course material at a detailed and moderate pace. Homework assignments can be done in 1-2 days and textbook not always needed (she has slides tho). She does iclicker questions and weekly quizzes and take attendence so show up to class. Also, allows cheat sheet and only 1 midterm plus final for class., I took CS151 over the summer just to take her CS152 course (she teaches CS156 now). She is the best lecturer anywhere. Lectures use iClicker polls, assignments use boilerplates and have clear rubrics. 13 weekly questions, 3 lowest dropped. Midterm was medium difficulty, final was brutally tough. Allows 1 cheat sheet. Creates concise lecture slides., Rula is a great professor and she is very helpful. However, if you are planning to take her for CS 156 then I would advise you to not to.  She uses slides from Berkley and they are sadly not very helpful. Furthermore, this class is not as exciting as you might think. It is more like a math/stats class than a CS class."
Terry Allen,/professor/1540109,2.5,N/A,3.7,"Hes a really nice guy, but you get the feeling, hes just collecting a pay check and has no interest in teaching, either that or hes just disconnected from his students. The assignments are graded by a TA so expect no feed back. He doesnt give you enough time to complete them, and his exams are ridiculously long. Nice guy, shouldnt teach., Allen is a great individual, but you will not understand his lectures.Although I liked 1-on-1 meeting with him.When it comes to hws, they are tricky and he wants them to be turned in within 24 hours.In reality, for a C programmer it would take about a week to finish.He is a great person to talk to, but not recommended for teaching., Prof. Allen is a nice guy and does care about his students. However, his lectures were unhelpful. If you want to learn C you\re kind of on your own there. The assignments weren\t hard, but more just long and tedious and the due dates were only 2 days after the assignment was posted. The tests were hard, but he curves like crazy., Useless excuse for a professor. Gives unrealistically challenging assignments with only 48 hours to complete when many take a week or more. Gave absolutely NO feedback at all on homework or exams. Cant even turn his grades in by the final deadline., He is a very confused and unorganized person. It was a mission when it came to finding out what was due or when the exam was. There was absolutely no communication between him and the ta, which hurt the students more than anything., never returns graded work throughout the quarter and forgets to tell about assignments until the last week. Is a nice guy but has some real problems with organizing a class and responding to students, Professor Allen is a good man.  Takes ideas and decision of students into consideration.  Homework is really really tough.  Youll have a heck of a time trying to do them.  But youll learn a lot if you manage to do them.  Has a 1-on-1 with every student and he tells you about the real world of Computer Science.  Take him but take with caution :], Allen is a nice guy but the way he teaches the class can be somewhat frustrating. He lectures on random topics and is not always the best help when asking about the hw. He grades very generously but hell also give ridiculous tests and very time consuming hws. Take him but try to learn some C before taking him or you might get lost..., Decent teacher, very knowledgeable and knows his stuff. Very nice and always willing to help and answer questions. Class is hard but grades easy. Recommended., He is a great scholar or researcher, but not a good teacher. Its clear that he knows a lot about the computer architecture and C programming language, but its actually hard to get what he is talking about in class. He gives a very long test, and expect students to know a lot by their own. Not recommand to take the class., He rambles on. His tests are extremely long and he doesnt give you enough time. He gives you 2 days for homework which takes 2 weeks to do. Expects you to figure alot of stuff on your own. NOT RECOMMENDED., Hes extremely nice and really does care about his students. Hes always approachable for help if you dont understand the homework. Sometimes he goes off on tangents when he talks in class, but at least the tangents are still relevant to CS. Oh and he curves his midterms which are not so much difficult, but really really long."
Mira Jane,/professor/3040115,1.1,0%,4.8,"Terrible instructor, he does not even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how SJSU would hire someone this bad to teach. His lectures are confusing and he does not explain clearly. His exams are very hard and homework takes forever to finish, he thinks this is the only class students are taking. Please do students a favor and fire him., This professor has completely unrealistic standards for an introductory class. The lectures are useless because the exams and assignments are fully unrelated and much harder. Grading criteria is very unclear, and professor never gives clear answers to student questions. Overall, the class is confusing, poorly designed, and not worth the stress., Absolute dumpster fire of a class. Hes clearly knowledgeable, but is incapable of actually conveying any information. Avoid this professor at all costs, his class is an utter waste of time. Average on midterm was 8/40 with no curve; professor acknowledged that we didnt cover some of the topics in class and didnt seem to care., The lectures are boring & completely worthless. They do not cover any material in homework or on exams, and any questions are redirected to students who will not know answers themselves, because he is completely incapable of teaching. Youre on your own for homework. Its passable, but will be the absolute worst quality of education you ever have., I enrolled in Akash Nanavatis first class Fall 2024, he/she has since changed his/her name to Mira Jane. Was unable to teach students, 20% class average midterm. When we asked a question, we were told to ask our classmates. Taught grad level machine learning to undergrad students. No correlation between homework, lectures, and exams. SAVE YOURSELF, There is no way any student can pass this class. If you choose this Professor you are getting automatically a F. Lecture is very hard to understand. HW is no way near introduction to ML., If you are not a PHD graduate you are not passing the class. This is high level intensity of Machine learning topics that no seriously cant learn. The test is very difficult and as I would say impossible for master students. 96% of the class is failing. You being in the 4% percent, you wouldnt even need to go to SJSU. Just go to havard, DONT TAKE. Tests are a complete jokenothing like what you do in class. Theres no clear course outline, topics are covered too fast, and good luck getting your questions answered. The slides are utterly useless. The teaching is abysmal; its all just code lifted straight from the textbook, with barely any explanation. Save yourself the headache., The tests cover material not discussed in lectures, making them absurdly difficult and irrelevant. Professor is out of touch with what students should actually know. Instructions are vague at best, and forget about getting any useful help outside of class. Take this class only if youre ready to fail and retake it again the next semester."
Mariia Surmenok,/professor/2590561,5.0,100%,2.1,"Best Mommy Professor!\nClass was easy (at least, for a guy like me who knows Java). Made memes, had fun, and even had class discord. Has extra credit assignments, and has final team project. My team sucked and I had to do almost everything by myself, but I would gladly do it for her again. Its sad she left. I hope she found her wanted career, Take the class with a group of friends and enjoy. The slides are the answers to everything., Amazing teacher. The best one Ive had at SJSU so far. Her lectures are clear and informative. She gives extra credit participation points through iClicker so attend lecture and pay attention. Her tests are straight forward and fairly easy if you study and go over lecture material. The final group project is fun., Awesome professor. She understands her students really well. Took her online class Spring 2021. 3 Homeworks, 1 kinda big group project, 14 quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged as her lectures are useful and she offers a lot of extra credit. Would definitely take her again if I could., Fantastic Professor. Willing to go out of her way to help you out with homework and makes sure you understand. Lectures are easy to understand and very accessible. Test and are open notes/book and and homework are relatively easy to do but does help you practice. Overall a very awesome professor and class that actually teaches me new things as well, Had her for 49J and 151. She teaches the material pretty well and uses IntelliJ in class. Theres iClicker participation in class for extra credit in midterm and final. All homework and deadlines are reasonable. Theres weekly quizzes based on lectures. Generous in grading. Shes chill, I like her sense of humor. Id take care again if I could., Professor Surmenok is great. Weekly quizzes straight from lecture (lowest 3 dropped), a few hw assignments, 1 midterm, 1 group project, and 1 final. She has iClicker questions during lecture for extra credit. She is definitely understanding when it comes to online teaching and is very easygoing. If you follow lecture, easy A. I enjoyed her class!, Class became online halfway due to Covid 19. Her teaching is clear and makes sure everyone understands the concepts. She uses iClicker. 11 quizzes, 2 midterms, 1 final all based on lectures, all doable and reasonable. Homework load is ok. She was flexible and caring during Covid 19 crisis. I liked her a lot. Please dont change."
Yongwhan Lim,/professor/2775656,3.3,58%,3.9,"I wouldnt recommend, The professor is no good. He is too formal and does not how to teach. Students sleep in his class lol, Worst professor ever! Do not take his class. He does not teach anything and blames his students. He literally tries to tear their mental health apart. I warn you!, Professor Lim is very knowledgeable and encourages students to ask questions in class. His class is more code-driven and less theory driven. He directs his time towards areas that students are particularly struggling to grasp. In particular, he spent a lot of time on DP algorithms, which helped me immensely during coding interviews., I got a little bit overwhelmed at the beginning of the class due to a lot of different topics of data structures and algorithms. (Not because of the professor, it is the class nature to be challenging.) However, I was able to follow Professor Lims guidance. He gave us a lot of feedback and help us to learn better. You will learn a lot from him!, Professor Lim has great knowledge about algorithms. If you ask a question about an algorithm, he will be able to answer the question quickly, with details. If you are going to take the class, it would be better if you are able to implement some algorithms. Get ready to learn! If you dont understand it, ask the professor!, Professor Lim is one of those professors who prioritize learning over grades, which lets students focus more on their problem solving and not worry about grades too much. The class is very helpful when it comes to interview preparation."
Ashok Banerjee,/professor/985819,4.3,N/A,2.5,"Fantastic Professor. Comes from Industry background and provides good exposure to what is relevant. Clear concepts and very approachable., Worst prof in CMPE 273 , Undergrad type assignments, goes out of country for 5 weeks in between the sem, exams meaningless , childish professor, typical indian mentality! Avoid him totally! Simon shim and Sithu Aung are 1000% better than him., The Professor has profound knowledge in the field of Enterprise software. I would suggest you to start your EST specialization under him., Great professor with profound industrial knowledge and class participation really matters., Excellent Professor who comes with industrial background! He makes sure basic concepts are cleared and is always open to questions. Throws a lot of questions to class and is very helpful. Hands down, the best class for distributed systems., Very strong industry background and able to understand and explain at every level of the Software Stack. Right from OS, Networking to JVM, Web 2.0 and EJB, JMS, XA. Utilizes reinforcements in learning by throwing questions to the class during and after class. Encourages class participation"
Quang Duy Tran,/professor/2971637,3.0,50%,3.7,"Took this course a few semesters back but it wasnt difficult, watch the lectures + follow the slides and the assignments should be easy. The professor was really quick + responsive to emails, so if you ever need help on an assignment or have questions hell help you., I recommend taking this class with literally any other professor. Grading criteria is very vague and unclear. Youll be deducted points on his assignment, midterms, and final for requirements thatre never mentioned in the description. He gives 2 midterms and a final which are each worth 25% of the grade. He is also very slow at grading everything., Duy overall is a nice guy. Being that hes a grad student, hes busy. So expect slow replies to emails and slow grading. There are only a few projects that determine your grade, and his grading criteria is extremely particular but unspecific. There are several requirements that you can be deducted on that he wont tell you about UNLESS YOU ASK., Emphasizes the mistakes to not make often so you will do well as long as you pay attention to them. He is lenient on extending deadlines. His slides also have example codes that you can use. Can take a while to get things graded since hes a grad student. He also records his lectures and posts them. Exams were take home and can take some thinking., Student teacher so hes pretty chill. Willing to give out extensions on assignments if needed. Assignments are easy if you pay attention to his lectures since he literally tells you what to expect. Assignment descriptions were made vague to deter students from using AI, but it did make it confusing and people still used chatGPT and stuff so, Inconsistent grading with no clear rubric or homework/project requirement. Dismissive of students concerns and recommendations. Tardy with grading, had to wait on average up to 2-3 weeks for homework to be graded. For the finals, I did not even get to see my score and just received a final grade. Worst class I have taken in the CS dept."
Saroj Sabherwal,/professor/2056535,1.7,0%,2.8,"Doesnt make her own lecture materials.  Had us write summaries of chapters out of the book instead of covering the material herself.  Every test was take home, including final exam.  Homework assignments had way too many problems, but were simple.  You can safely skip every lecture if you can read the books.  Avoid., 5 HW 3 exam 1 final 1 group project all worth 10%. All are TAKE HOME and formatted same (3-4 Qs). Laid back and doesnt really care about teaching. Goes through some slides and writes on board but mainly self-taught. Use other resources to really learn. Take if you want a guaranteed A or B but if you want to really learn take someone else., Literally reads the slides word for word as a way to go over chapters. Does not emphasize on bullet points and as a result, her lectures skim through chapters. The homework was an insult to a juniors/senior level CS students intelligence. This class has really put the BS in BSCS., Take-home exams. Pushes back due dates twice. 11:59 due time means submit before, not at.   Get ready to read, indeed. So far, I am having to be my own professor - she has taught literally nothing. She is incredibly repetitive and vague. Nine group projects - same topic. Asked the same question 8 times (which should be learned from the class!), Very lazy teacher. She kind of rambles and reads directly from her power point slides and asks the class a lot of vague and ambiguous questions. Every single homework and test she has assigned has been collected at a date later than she assigned. Tests are take home. Everything I learned in this class Ive read from the book."
Devangi Chinchankar,/professor/2723102,4.0,100%,3.8,"Shes a software engineer at Facebook now! Shes great!, I took her for the first class of CS in SJSU. There are 3 tests in this class: 2 midterms and 1 final. Do all of your homework and participation exercises then you will be fine in 2 midterms. However, the final will be a little bit more difficult than the other tests. And the next thing is ready to read the textbook she assign before every lecture., A professor that inspires me to become more involved in Computer Science, thank you Professor!, Professor Devanji responds to questions very quickly so you can always contact her about your concerns! There is 1 quiz and 1 homework assignment due every week. You also must attend her lectures since she uses iclicker for participation points and she goes over participation assignments that are also due the next day."
Neha Gupta,/professor/1921124,4.0,N/A,2.3,"Very good teacher, and she will give you a lot of help if you need it. We had four textbooks but I only really used one, and we didnt need it right away. Id recommend to wait until class starts to get them., She once held extra classes on Fri and Sat for students who failed the quiz to have a private tutoring with her. In the beginning, she wouldnt make a lot of sense because Chapter 1 had many theories, its not her fault. But, once you get to Datapath and above, everything started to make sense and suddenly you would realize that shes very smart!, Neha is a great professor, she knows the materials very well. However, English is not her first language, so sometimes its difficult for her to explain some concepts or answer questions. There are a lot of materials covered in this class, so attending her lecture is very important. Besides, she gives 5% for participation and an A is 85% or above"
Charles Bocage,/professor/2189191,1.0,0%,5,"One of the worst professors SJSU can offer. Makes students seem student everytime you ask a question so no one wants to ask anything unless they liked getting called out in class. Not only that, but we didn\t even have class unless you had questions about youtube videos he posts in 240p and in 6 font so you can\t even see what he is saying. AVOID, Not recommended because you wont learn anything. He didnt care to teach anything whole semester. Very harsh grading., You wont learn anything. Take any other teacher but not him. All the lectures were recorded and posted on youtube. Class time was only for asking any question so entire semester was a joke. He gives zeros if you mess up on a single little thing. 8 Programming assignments, 1 midterm, 1 Project, 2 Homeworks, 1 Final. All the material is from Patra."
Quang Tran,/professor/2944621,5.0,100%,2.7,"Very straightforward course outline as the HW assignments build on each other and the concepts are combined on midterms and finals. Professor is great at explaining new technologies that are introduced in this class (PHP, Javascript, MySQL). He is generous and understanding with deadlines for HW and Midterms/Finals (everything is take home)., I enjoyed Professor Quang Trans class. Slows down and explains the hard things, goes over all the exam questions in depth before each exam. He was a great teacher and wanted to see students succeed. He was always willing to help and offer a lot of extra credit, but it was for a good reason. If you participate and try to learn, you will do fine., It was doable when taking this course with professor Tran as his lectures and materials were straightforward and concise. He was inspiring and easily approachable outside class whenever I sent email to ask questions. You need to pay attention during lectures for his exams, to be honest. Will definitely take him again for other courses., Currently taking his 174 course right now. The content is pretty lecture-heavy and theres an assignment every few weeks based on lecture content. Grading criteria are a little unclear at first but hes really approachable so ask a lot of questions if you need to."
Juan Gomez,/professor/2264107,3.0,50%,4.5,"Great professor. Should practice well to do well in tests., His classes are very time consuming. We need to give at-least 7 to 10 hours of studying per week. You can pass his classes but it is very stressful and heavy workload of assignments. Upside is you will end up studying a lot and gaining good knowledge but comes at a heavy cost. If you are taking then make sure you are ready to put in a many hours."
Ritik  Mehta,/professor/2928770,3.5,50%,3.5,"Good Professor. First time teaching so have to give him some leeway. Exams are all from the slides. Usually quick in responing to emails., The professor is still new because it is his first year teaching so it cannot be perfect like another professor I can understand. But just to be more clear on exam review instead of reading all slides from the class, only 5% material will be covered in the exam such a waste of time for students. Do more live coding than reading the slides"
Daniel Quintana,/professor/2996532,5.0,100%,3,I wasnt sure what to expect since Daniel does did not have any reviews prior to taking his course but I can by far say he is one of the best professors I have taken at SJSU. He is very interactive in class and allows you to actually try the things he is teaching through the hands ons. He super approachable and treats his students like real people.

Michael Beeson,/professor/3,3.1,N/A,3,"Well... the subject of differentials & linear algebra is hard. That said, he does try to make it as easy as possible by using variation of example problems on the midterms. Sample midterm/ final was just like the real exam. Study, Study, Study. Got by this class by self-learning everything from khan academy and youtube. Textbook is useless, Math 123 can be one of the hardest courses for engineering students at SJSU. Therefore, I believe that Prof. Beeson has done the best he could. I dont know why people keep complaining about partial credit, but I agree with his point of view - If you want to become an engineer, you are not allowed to make mistakes. Thats life, deal with it., Prof. Beeson is extremely apathetic to students, he does not care if you pass or fail. On exams, he does not give any partial credit, which is extremely odd for a math class. Even if you did the problem correct but made a mistake, you lose all your points for one question because Mr. Beeson expects you to be perfect. Strongly do not recommend him, I sleep in class and I still manage to average a B grade for the 3 midterms., Hes so boring and even makes me feel sleepy. I always plays computer games during classes and have to learn the knowledge by myself, 2 midterms, 1 final. 10 questions total, and doesnt give partial credit or any extra credit. His voice is very monotone, making it difficult to pay attention. Whats worse is trying to understand his handwriting. Half the time, I couldnt read what he wrote because it was so tiny and pretty much chicken scratch. Try to avoid taking him., Decent professor, knows his material really well but isnt effective in teaching it to other... tests and exams arent too bad they are similar to the sample exams he gives... similar concepts just different problems... quizzes time to time... be prepared to learn the majority of the lectures on your own..., DO NOT take this professor, terrible at speaking and explaining. Tests are only a few questions and a lot of points. Gave one section an easier final than the other, and does not give partial credit., I took calculus before so the class wasnt as hard however, his tests are only 10 problems usually and each is worth a ton and he doesnt give partial credit usually so you have to exact. No calculators for his class and random quizzes in class from time to time. Hw is easy all done on an online program no effort, will you learn calculus, maybe., This proffesor is a total joke, avoid him at all costs. He manages to take a not too challenging subject into something impossible., Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.        Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class., Beeson is one the first professors that I had at SJSU. He lives and breathes the CLRS book. His lectures are very clear, but the projects, which account for 50% of the grade are difficult, so work on them early. Tests were easy and open book. Come to lecture and take notes!, He analyzes everything you say like a bad shrink. The other commenter wasnt kidding when they said he stops for minutes at a time to contemplate the next step. Heard of planning? No calculators, which would be fine except that some test questions are ridiculous without one (eg. plug 5/4 into 4x^3+15x^2+12x+6. Actual step in a final exam Q), Because he spent several years creating his math software, he believes its the ultimate teacher when teaching calculus.  Hes apathetic to students, expects so much from them. Very unclear, boring. Ive never had a math prof. who pauses for days thinking whats the next step to take in a math problem., Smart and very nice teacher. Good teach style. Lector is organized. Know how to teach student. know how to separate the section and assignment, then student could learn step by step. Not push too much. You need to read the book before listen the lecture. Learn a lot from the course. Very useful course overall., Very hard homework but easy tests.  If you listen to the lectures and attend class you will do great, reading the book is mostly optional., Hes a damn good professor but he can be a bit of a jerk sometimes.  I was in the section where he yelled at the whole class for 30 minutes because half of the people in both sections failed the 2nd midterm.  Just keep up with the lecture notes, study before midterms, and do all the HW.  You should do just fine., Beeson is one of the best teachers Ive had at this school.  Its a hard class, but he explains things well. Ive never met a teacher that was as willing to help students as this guy.  Hell take a later bus home to santa cruz if people still need help!  Dont take this class with any other teacher. Trust me., Beeson is a hardass when it comes to grading but if you prepare for his class every day you will benefit. He  cares about you coming to class and doing all the daily problems, you will come out of this class ready to produce industry level code. He seems to care deeply about the quality of engineers sjsu pumps out, that is you, better study!, Hes a little nuts but hes very smart and is really interested in the subject of CS146.  Id strongly recommend him for that class., If you want to flunk, take his class. He assumes you can learn on your own, write your own code without his lecture or explanation. Not to mention he is a good knowledgeable professor but he cant teach. He has to transform his knowledge to the  students which he doesnt do. Borrow code from already taken friends to get an A. Coming from a B+ stude, READ THE GREEN SHEET.  Beeson is one of the best teachers at SJSU.  Actually tries to get his students to think.  READ THE WHOLE GREEN SHEET.  If you do ALL the lab preparation exercises and attend EVERY lab, then the homework, midterms and final will be  easy.  Seriously though, make sure you READ THE ENTIRE GREET SHEET., You have to stay engaged in this class throughout the semester to do well. If you read the lecture notes and practice them labs will flow easy for you. Midterms are fair assuming you have been doing the work. Overall hes a very good professor that will teach you a lot--if you let him., You MUST do homework during lab. So only about one hour to finish your homework or you get a C. You have to read lectures at home and do them on your own time. This was changed as of fall 2008. Very confusing instructions and professor not very helpful at all. AVOID him! Youre better off learn on your own, he does not teach., He is a terrific teacher.  Read the assigned text before coming to class or you will be lost in the lecture.  Read your notes when you go home.  Dont just DO the HW.  Do more than the assignment asks until you understand the topic.  Do every program ON TIME.  Miss one and you will fail.  First sign of trouble, see him during office hours., 10-12 labs, six assignments, two midterms, and one final. He makes sure that we are engaged throughout the semester. Clarifies every question and responds back with sufficient suggestions. As per grading, you get what you earn!, This class is easy as long as you attend lecture and write the code prior or afterwards.  Lab is mandatory and consists of EXACTLY what you cover in lecture.  He goes slightly off from his notes online which is why lecture is important to attend.  Very enjoyable lectures and happy to help out at office hours.  Your grade is the effort put in!, Knows a lot about programing, but is one of the worst teachers ive had! does not put a lot of time in helping students; really lazy, and bad handwriting on the board. Makes a lot of mistakes in the class, but if you make the smallest mistake on HW or test, you lose a lot of points!, One of the quirkiest professors I\ve had.  Given to tantrums when students arrive late.  Doesn\t seem prepared for lecture, but that may be relevant to first class in the day (presume he\s rehearsed for later sections).  Exams are open book/notes, but are hard. Mandatory programming are HARD! Missed assignments result in an F in the course!, A great teacher! is kind of lazy trying to grade hw and stuff, but you get what you put into the class... very helpful!, One of the worst profs SJSU has. Totally illegible in his teaching. spends little or no time explaining the subject clearly. i feel bad having such a prof for such an interesting subject., I am not sure what other people are talking about. CS130 is the easiest class I have taken at SJSU. His classes consist of coding in front of students and showing every detail that was on the exams. He does require you to attend labs and complete homeworks, so it does take some coding effort - but if you are in CS you should probably do it..., Good professor. BUT his exam is always including  new material that he didnt teach in class which could kill your grade. Its like Hey class I got Surprise for you!!!. So, half of class this Fall 2006 got an F on the final exam( 23 students), 6 students got D, 8 students got C, 5 students got B , and yes there are 24 favorite A students of him., Got A in his class Fall 2006. Few friends who good at programming didnt do too well so Im speaking for everyone. He screwed up big time on his 2nd midterm by not mentioning in his spec that the dialog should be initialized by fields on the main form. As a result, blind mindless idiots just followed the homework and got As because he stopped gradin, he is a useless prof...very unfair grader. gives an f if u dont submit even 1 assignment. he is a pathetic moron, very unfair on grading. unclear lectures. he doesnt know what hes saying. unprepared lectures., DONT take 146 from him. A) He doesnt know Java very well. B) if you miss even ONE assignment during the semester, you get an F in the class. Even if you turn in all of them, if you dont do well on 2-3, you will still get an F, regardless of test grades. Also randomly assigned more work, flunk you if you dont do it, but not give points if you do, This class is the most fun of all the CS classes. The hws are fun and he gives you a lot of hints. The midterms and finals are cake since all you do is write a short program in lab. He gives you many opportunities to get an A+. If you do not get an A in this class you should change your major., well prepared and organized, speaks well. If you study the class notes youll pass the class easily. if you put in a bit more effort youll defenitelly get a good grade. I liked the class and the teacher, not a hard class at all, but dont be lazy. (it helps if you read the notes before the class, then its much easier to get/remember the content), Class is very easy. His notes are online, so you never need to go to class and the lab is just about following directions and looking up class notes. Grading is easy and only based on programming, no major tests. He teaches by code, not through a book. Its an easy A+, but then again, its C#. You right click and program practically writes itself., This teacher is just awesome!!! Very well prepared lectures and clear samples. Not afraid to give an A. Do all the homework, run the samples, and you are set. I think the course is very good for future cs programmers who do want to program., taking his class is a waste of time.  i could learn windows programming on my own.  his final is stupid, he doesnt even other looking at the code you write., Pretty horrible professor with time management issues. Spends a good portion of each lecture talking about nothing, and ends up going over in time because he didnt finish the lecture. Class is really easy. You dont need to go to class, just practice the online notes. Cant really teach but tries., Dont get excited if you get As by beggining of the course. By 3 quarter of semester you most likely to get Bs, & C on final! In the beginning you know exactly what you doing, however, at the end you have no clue! The guy says to cutnpaste code from his website & dont bother understanding it!, The beginning of the course is fun, since the prof. goes into a lot of details. However, he wastes a lot of time talking about irrelevant stuff and ends up catching up at the nd of the course. Too much stuff left unexplaned, but asked on the finals! You have to surf the web to find many answers!!!, Hes an alright teacher, you dont really have to go to the lectures, just read the notes and try the stuff for yourself to make sure you get it. I went to his office hours a couple times, pretty helpful; and you cant argue with XP Pro for 7 bucks., Hella easy class. Most people end up getting As. You dont even have to go to class. All his lecture notes are posted online. His lectures are boring anyway. Make sure you do the practice midterms before you go into the real ones., Hes a decent guy, although you have to sit through a lot of pure talk and not even take any notes. Labs and hw are what count, and its easy to follow if you follow his online notes. I recommend him., Arrogant!!!!!!!!!!!!  He will mention his stupid MathXPert program at least a hundred times.  He enjoys reprimanding his students.  Very difficult to communicate with.  Dont take this jack@$$!, One of the more arrogant teachers in the CS department. Dont bother going to his office hours unless you are first in line.  He usually spends all his time helping 1 student. The material is good but when you ask him for help he is difficult. Study notes, His online lecture notes make up the textbook and they are really helpful.  He walks you through the homeworks.  Everything is channeled through his web site so you never have to worry about missing things if you miss class. Labs are easier then they look, Great guy. Pretty easy class. Grade pulled down by really hard multiple choice take home quizes. Lectures are really boring., wants to help, but sometimes stumbles over words., Better make sure that you do your own work or the final is a B*tch"
Yan Chen,/professor/2628898,3.3,62%,3.1,"minimal guidance on concepts and assignments. Be prepared to deal with assignments and mini-projects on your own. The course is demanding and requires significant time and effort because you need to self study a lot cause she wont teach anything. Consider other options if possible, She has a strong accent, so its hard to catch what shes saying sometimes. Lectures are just her reading straight from the slides, so honestly, its easier to just check the slides she posts on Canvas later. If youre really trying to learn Java, this probably isnt the best way. I ended up watching YouTube tutorials to make sense of the material., The positive feedback here seems to focus only on her lenient grading and skipping the final exam. However, she cant  teach effectively fundamental topics, making it feel like you have to learn all by yourself without a teacher. Consider other options if theyre available., She generously offered extra credit opportunities and reviewed solutions during class.  I highly recommend attending her class regularly. The final project may be challenging, but she provides valuable feedback and allows for resubmission.  The class is quite manageable., I took Yan Chens 166 this semester and thought it was great. +-30% extra credit from optional HW, +3% EC if you get >50% on midterms, and you can substitute your final grade with the sum of your midterm scores and EC on top. She cares about her students and makes the class accessible and fun. I recommend doing lots of EC; little time on exams., 175 is fairly straightforward. The class is structured to teach things, mostly through exercises and projects. It is up to you however to decide what you learn and dont learn from the class, if you use it for the term project or not. Is very easy to get an A., Would only recommend the class if you want the credit for the course. Mostly self-learning from her lecture videos and slides. Do all the extra credit (especially the project) and you should be very fine, even if you bomb the final., Terrible lecturer. Talks fast with heavy accent and doesnt give time to digest what she rambles about, let alone take notes. She records, but if you go in person she goes over solutions to assignments. You can choose to skip final if you do the project(very difficult). Easy if you just want to pass. If you actually want to learn, take Ahmad., Dont know why rating is so low, She gives lots of extra credit and wants you to pass. Accent is bit hard to understand at first, but lecture slides are enough to study and pass. Attendance is not mandatory but if you attend exercise qs are discussed which are useful. As long as you are doing weekly work, passing this class is easy., Genuinely have no clue why her ratings are so low. Chen is a great lecturer and her slides are clear. Pay attention in class and everything should be fine. Her accent is perfectly understandable. Do all the HW. The group project is very digestible when broken into parts., Try get more EC, and do the project even if it is optional. This class is not that hard. Be prepared to read., Despite what other people may say about Professor Yan Chen, in my experience I thought she was a wonderful professor. Although her grading may seem harsh being that most of the grade is based on your final score, her lectures are very insightful and help a lot on material covered in exams. She is also very passionate about the topic as well., No idea why her reviews are so terrible. Shes a decent professor and her class structure makes it nigh-impossible to fail. Her classes typically have a very high average final grade. Course gets harder over time but youll have the option to add a percentage of your project score/HW score to your final. If you just try, you will end up with a B/A., Gives up to 30 pts of extra credit if you do all the optional assignments. Her lectures are straightforward, but she goes fast. She also records lectures and goes over the assignments in detail every class which is nice. Responds to emails quickly. Final used questions that were extremely similar to the optional assignments., Shes a bit hard to understand, but honestly I kind of enjoyed the class format. She posts all lectures and slides online, and your only homework is a weekly Canvas quiz. The grading is entirely final based, and your homework contributes as EC with an optional project to boost/replace grade. Completely manageable class, iffy prof., She has a heavy accent and could barely hear it. She reads everything off the slides in her lectures, so dont bother to go to the lectures, just read the slides she posts in Canvas later that day. If learning Java was your goal, this might not be it. Decided to watch YouTube tutorials about the lectures to understand them better., The weekly quizzes ramp up in difficulty exponentially, which super annoying. When she goes over the problems for the weekly quizzes she just does it and disregards that 90% of the class felt like unaliving themselves due to the difficulty of the problem. Project is also impossible, ITS EVEN a 4 person group project and still is impossible, Youll be fine taking her as long as you put adequate (not crazy) amount of effort into the class. Her lecture is really organized and she tried her best to explain the problems., Yan Chen is a great professor, but she speaks too fast, also if u take notes, dont even bother, you will miss important information. Weekly Quizzes, and her grading scale is easy to pass, kinda of difficult to get an A, but for sure you can get an passing grade most definitely. Overall she is far better than Ahmad who teaches 154 aswell., Bro this teacher cant speak english. If your taking CS or Software engineering pick someone else because she cant teach. She has the strongest chines accent to the point where you cant understand her. And if you ask her a question, you might as well ask her in Chinese. \nPICK SOMEONE ELSE., Chen definitely should get a higher rate. Take advantages for every possible EC/Assignments/Quizzes...and try your best to attend each lectures as they are helpful. Group project is not easy, but its optional. Follow the course progress, then everything is manageable - even get a good grade. Prof. is willint to help you improve grade if needed., I got an A in Summer 2023. I learned a lot from her. I agree that the final is 100pts which is the overall grade. But she offers 30pts of EC, 70pts for the project; both are optional. I took the final instead. It was way easier than the project. Some questions are exact or similar to the quizzes. To get an A, please do the 30pts EC with the final., Absolutely excellent class, does not deserve such a low rating. Solid curriculum, class is quite interesting, and offers an online option for those who do not want to come to class in person. Final is the entire class (100%), but the class offers around 60% of extra credit in the form of normal assignments and projects., Honestly not sure why Yan Chen has such a low average. Imo, shes a top g. Once you understand her grading, you can take real advantage and not even take the final. My only criticism is that she can speak quite fast at times. Highly recommend!, Not sure why people are saying she cant teach regarding CS154, I feel like I learned more from her compared to Ahmad who has a higher rating. (Im retaking with her). She could go a bit fast, but shes organized and is accessible., I am surprised the rating is so low. To me, she is ok. She puts lots of effort in lectures and homework, and responds email quickly. Sometimes she cant explain topics in depth though., I dont think a 2/5 is warranted, Ive taken way worse profs with higher RMP scores. Easy class, if you put in the work you can learn. Lots of extra credit; grading system is confusing, but if you do all the assignments you can skip the final exam to get an A., The only positive reviews here refer to her easy grading and not taking the final. Unfortunately, she cant teach the basic subjects so you are better off with no teacher. Avoid her if you have other options, if you do well on the term project + extra credits, you will get an A without taking the final., Teach you 1 + 1 = 2, the homework is to ask you to answer Calculus, Extremely dangerous professor. No proper explanation of concepts and you are on your own for assignments and mini projects. Very time consuming course. Avoid, Clear grading criteria and an easy class in general. You will learn some fundamental topics of information security, including cryptology, authentication/authorization, hash, etc. 2 midterms and 1 final, and the average of 2 midterms can cover final, which is awesome because you may not need to take the final!, She puts too less effort in teaching as she told us she is looking for another full time job. Dont expect much from teaching as she cant explain anything. Most of the material I had to learn myself from youtube videos as her lectures worth zero. Assignments outdated and constantly updated AFTER being assigned. Didnt get much from this class :), - There are 25 points of extra credits so you could get up to 125 points. I got 115 points last semester.\n- You can get an A if you have 93 points, so easy A for me\n\nExercises and Projects took a lot of time. The professor was nice if you talk to her. Why there are many bad reviews; maybe it is because they dont want to do too much homework, Grading may seem scary as the Final is 100%, but the lecture slides help a lot to understand materials. There are about 30 points of extra credit for doing assignments and discussions. Lots of questions in the Final are exactly from assignments or similar. Overall is not a hard class, really like her lecture slides as they explain concepts clear., As long as you do the assignments, guaranteed to pass the class. Grading criteria is not difficult to understand. The class was extremely boring. She just reads off the slides and holds the class there till the end of class time even if there is no content left., Pros: Class is project based. We did a few mini projects and a final project. Every exercise is well designed, which helped me to understand the material in depth. Quiz is optional; Cons: she read off the slides. Its hard to understand the content without a demo., She teaches a lot in class. It is beyond what can fit into one semester. She talks fast as she rushes against time and brushes off questions. She only covers the basics, cant explain in depth. Difficult exams., Other than her going too fast and not going extremely in depth, her lectures are straight forward and also uploads recordings on Canvas. She provides a lot of extra credit opportunities so it should be relatively easy to get a passing grade. Midterm and finals are long but are questions that youve encountered before. Would recommend., Not too bad! Has office hour appointments available if you need more help. Weekly assignments are simple, based from lectures and are EC. Also has easy discussions that are EC. Exams are time-crunched, so you need to work fast. Okay explainer of concepts and wished she talked slower. Project is long and hard: maybe better to do final exam instead., No clue why people complain about grading criteria, its an easy to understand points system. You need 70 points to pass out of the total 130 you can earn throughout the class from assignments and exams. She is very caring, gives extensions if students need and grades quickly. Lecture slides are presented in an organized and concise way. Take her!, The most wholesome professor ever. Short, simple lectures. Easy quizzes. Grading system is not confusing as what other reviews state. 130 possible POINTS total, just need 93 POINTS to get A. Shes not lazy to grade because she has graders who help her and she once spent her whole night to grade the project so that we know if we need to take final, Honestly, idk why her rating is so low. She is very caring and a good teacher and I really enjoyed her class. The topic is obviously hard but she does the best with class Final not mandatory if you do hw assignments/quizzes and project. Alternatively, you can also do none of the hw and only take the final as your grade. Hw are based on lectures., Her presentations were ok, but I just didnt like the fact that if we asked her deeper questions regarding certain topics, she would straight up not know. Other than that, her grading system is weird. Final is worth 100% of your grade, but you can earn up to 30% extra credit. The only thing I liked about the class were the assignments and quizzes., Professor Chen is one of the best CS professors at SJSU. Shes really caring, wants you to do your absolute best, and is very flexible in working with you to succeed. Attending class wasnt mandatory but quiz/exercise passwords are given out during class. 4 Mini Projects and a Group Final project. Final project is graded by prof. and by the class., I think she is too lazy and inexperienced. Assignments are optional as she is too lazy grading them. No clarity in the lectures and slides. She just reads the slides which are copied from other profs. Very long and difficult final exam. You are on your own in terms of learning. Better of with no teacher. Avoid., The workload of this class was manageable compared to other classes I took. The slides were well-formatted and easy to follow and review after class. Prof responded to the email fast and cleared the confusion either in class or make announcements asap. I finished the weekly assignment and a project to get an A without taking a final., The final is literally 100% of the grade and is way too long. Her slides are extremely confusing and it is difficult to understand what she is saying as she talking fast and has a thick accent. Your better off learning off youtube. Lots of extra credit in the form of hw and discussion questions. Definitely would not recommend., Not recommended. No clarity and very confusing grading system., grade is 100% final. quiz/exam are extra credit 1-2points each. Very generous with ec but you have to work for it. turing machine proj can replace final but I was told final was easier. Especially if you did all the quiz. Lectures are excellent and very organized, no need to self study to understand the material. Tricky with mc questions."
Paul Nguyen,/professor/2553649,5.0,100%,2.1,"Great teacher, great material, What a wonderful Professor.  He is responsive to emails and very knowledgeable about cyber security and its issues that go along with that and its procedures., Professor Paul Nguyen is one of the easiest, friendliest, and most helpful teachers I have ever had. Even if you submit a wrong assignment, he will still let you resubmit again without deducting your points. It does not make sense if I do not give him 5 stars for rating and 1 star for difficulty. Thank you for a comfortable and smooth semester., Great professor! Assignments were not difficult and grading criteria is easy to understand. You will get an A if you do the assignments., Class was organized in a way that it made everything super easy. Assignments were not difficult and easy to get an A if you submit your work. Great professor and would take his class again!, Super chill professor who makes getting an A as easy as possible. Group exams and Project account for most of the grade. Only downsides were requiring outdated software like gns3 and mgsoft which do not work well for macs. Also the professor has a thick accent so lectures are sometimes hard to understand., I enrolled in ISDA121 with Professor Nguyen, who is genuinely attentive to his students. During the final project, when someone encountered difficulties, he willingly provided clarification through a video explanation. Additionally, he has been supportive of my career by serving as a reference, and I greatly appreciate it., In my opinion I believe that one of my professors abilities was good teaching style, like the class was sorted out. It was very well organized which matters the most to me., Great Professor! I will take his class again., I would recommend the professor to anyone!, Great professor!, Not a harsh grader and assignments werent that difficult. Just make sure you actually do the work and put in some reading time., Paul Nguyen is a great professor. His class consisted mainly of discussion posts and a couple of exams. The assignments and exams are pretty easy and straightforward if you read the assigned textbook chapters. Hes a fair grader and does not assign unnecessary busy work or long papers. All the assigned work directly relates to the lesson/lecture., Professor Nguyen is great! All the modules were clear to understand and follow along. His class is asynchronous and as long as you manage time to turn assignments in on time you will do just fine., One of the best professors at SJSU info science. Very fair grader and class was straightforward and informative. He also works in the industry so he gave useful information. Great professor to take if you can, Pauls class is quite simple and straightforward. Only 1 midterm, couple of assignments and a final. Very little work is assigned over the semester and examinations are not a surprise, to you. He tells you what to expect and stuff., The class was made up of weekly discussions, a midterm, a final, and some labs/assignments. Professor Nguyen explained how to complete or what is expected in each lab/assignment, so I had no trouble completing them. The topics he chose were helpful in making me learn a lot about cybersecurity policies and practical industry tools., Professor Nguyen is probably one of the easiest professors you can take at SJSU. Our semester only had 4 things (2 midterms, 1 final, and 1 group project), which the professor has gone over multiple times. He also opens up office hours frequently when students need him for assistance., This class is project-oriented. Prof. Nguyen taught us how to use leading network simulation and management software and explains material that is strongly related to the industry. Optionally, you can do Cisco Net Academy to receive a certificate for free. Exams are very straightforward., Professor Nguyen is an exemplary professor and taught one of my favorite classes at SJSU. His assignments were very hands on, which helped me grasp the material better. I gathered a lot of skills that I can apply in the real world in this class, and I have professor Nguyen to thank for that., Professor Nguyen is an amazing, caring, and hilarious professor who answers questions and helps us understand the material. The projects are challenging yet doable, allowing us to apply what weve learned in a practical way. I appreciate his dedication and guidance. I highly recommend taking his class., Extremely nice and caring professor, very practical learning and applications to real life. Highly recommend., Awesome Professor by far one of my best experiences in university. He really teaches valuable and tangent things that you put on your resume and use in real life jobs. Understanding and professional. Helps whenever anyone ask for help. Highly recommended. Other teachers, take notes from him please., Easy class, light on lectures. Overall easy enough to pass, Very informative class on network management. Prof Paul is very knowledgeable in the field so he knows how to lecture the materials. Exams are straight forward from his lectures. Students who found them difficult is because they dont attend classes. If you pay attention to his lectures, then an A is very doable., Professor is straightforward but very detailed and helpful when he teaches the material. He always explains material related to the industry and offers class time to explain any material or homework we may need extra assistance with. Quizzes are open books from CISCO Net Academy, but the material is interesting and relative., One of the best Professor to take if you wanted to learn Network Management. Youll learn a lot from the lab and it wasnt that difficult to understand. He will teach you how to use GNS3 and MIB Browser for the Final project which is pretty easy to do. Overall, great Professor to take! Hella recommend, I feel professor Paul really has passion to teach this course. While his accent make his speaking a little bit hard to understand, he keeps explaining the material until all the people understand it. He also set up a 1 to 1 office hours for any student, who need his help. A really ez going professor, and I do recommend people taking class with him., this professor is great, I hope I can learn all my courses with him, Very cool teacher, he emphasized that hes not here to purposely make the class harder or fail students and that he wants to teach the more practical side of networking. You learn different networking protocols and do hands-on homework and exams. Had 3 exams and 1 final, which are all exactly like the homework so there are no surprises., Great professor. He explained networking well and made it easy to understand with good hands-on practice. He provided good feedback and answered all queries with examples. Take it and you wont regret it., Super cool teacher, 100% recommend him. Empathetic guy who knows what hes talking about., Paul focuses more on the practical side of things. That includes his lectures and tests. Be ready to get your hands dirty throughout the semester as youll be expected more to know how to do something than to know what something is. If you love hands on, then take him! Paul is very caring so though so even if you struggle, hell be there to help., He really cares about his students and helping them get a job. Take him, you wont regret it., Professor Nguyen is overall a respectable lecturer. His classes revolves around Ciscos academy web course with a final project to demonstrate network management. The final project requires you to know industry tools and protocols. It can be group or individual; I did it individually. Expect work for the final project but easygoing for lectures., Chapter lectures and slides were sometimes stale and boring. He makes it up with the labs and final being interesting and fun. He had no problem extending assignments when he saw a lot of us were struggling. He even spent some lectures just answering questions. I had a rough time this semester but he was super nice and understanding., I loved his class! I feel as if I learned a lot more in this class than I would have in another. His style of teaching is way more geared towards real life scenarios rather than textbook hypotheticals. Take him, he is a great professor and you will learn a lot!, Gives good practical homework assignments that give you some exposure to industry tools early on., He is a very kind and warmhearted professor. During COVID19 I had struggled with my assignments and exams but he helps me to learn and he schedule a meeting outside of class time and taught me until I get it right. Thank you professor Nguyen!, During the quarantine, I completely lost control of my classes and fell very behind in his class. However, he was very kind and stayed extra after class and had appointments to help me get back on track. Thank you professor Nguyen!, Very good instructions, clear applicable material to the real world., Good professor in general. Professor Paul is very knowledgeable with networking and therefore he will give you the best knowledge from the industry, plus he also work at Cisco so the stuffs he teaches will be relevant for whoever want to work in the networking field when they graduate. HW and exams are doable. Everyone all receive good grades., Prof Paul Tuan Nguyen is very caring, answers class questions promptly, and creates useful homework assignments that help students learn the protocols much better. Professor does not hesitate to take extra time to help those who ask him. He has a lot of knowledge, and makes sure you only learn things useful to your future. I hope he teaches again!, Professor Paul Tuan Nguyen (not to be confused with the other comp e Prof Paul Nguyen at SJSU) is very practical. With his background in Cisco, he focuses his lectures on practicality rather than theory. At his other college, Ohlone College, he has a rating of 4.9. He cares about his students and is very empathetic. I recommend this professor:)"
Augstin Araya,/professor/222698,3.3,N/A,3.2,"He is one of the most organized professors i have ever met. Very very good teacher, Very good professor. His slides were very clear and clarified all concepts properly. He is not partial and does fair grading., dont ever take his class. partial and discourage weak & his non-favorite students. he creates a barrier between good and bad students and he also has list of his fav. and non-fav. students. no curving nothing..thats all ****., Good prof with corny jokes.  Explains things pretty well and really knowledgeable about OS.  Make sure you select hard working ppl for your semester project or youll be screwed.  Exams are hard but he curves like hell., He has a strong accent. His program assignments are long but doable. His exams are long and hard but he curves big time. If you attend class regularly, read the book and study youll do just fine., Cons: His notes are badly organized but the notes are very important for midterm and final. Pros: Professor Araya is enthusiastic about this subject, he is very willing to help, he has a sense of humor - he resembles The World Most Interesting Man.  To Do Well make sure you study the final review questions and midterm review questions.  Good Luck, Very Good that\s the only words I understand him. He has a very thick Spanish accent. His class is boring and not very useful. Not recommended., He\s teaching style is not that effective and not very helpful in office hours. He\s an ok teacher if you may. If you have some experience programming and you participate you should be ok., Teaching, sometimes makes you feel little boring. But once you get into project and observe the real world UI designs, you would start appreciating the course. Responds back to questions and suggests well., A lot of busy work, teaching concepts that are obsolete. Vague directions regarding assignments. No response to inquiries to clarify the assignment. Team based assignments throughout the duration of the term. Panalising grading policy. Penalizes students for being bad test takers, or for have lazy group members., not organized, gets lost in his own presentation at times. make sure he knows u by name, else all ur hard work is just a waste of time. answer his questions even if ur answer is not connected to the question he asked. his project involves lots of redundant work., If you take his class, make sure to start the semester in a group of hard working students, otherwise, the semester long group project will screw you up. Nice, helpful professor, sometimes vague on project insturctions, very long hw and tests., Projects are not as difficult as long and time consuming. His exams are doable., His exams are doable, just study the lecture notes. Tends to skim quickly over some subjects, tho. Projects are VERY long, and generate some questions because of their wording, some of which dont get answered and you have to guess. He is a nice guy (some cheezy jokes)..so overall the class is ok. I could see why some would choose Horstmann, tho., His lectures are very boring, maybe its due to my lack of interest in the subject but everyone seemed bored too. Assignments are unclear plus has group work, which sucks if you have group members whom are lazy. Nice guy but doesnt seem interested in teaching and his lectures shows it. I wouldnt take him again, You can take his cs151, but never take his cs160. His exams and projects are very long and difficult. you will become a crazy man or woman., I had him for object oriented design. At firs the accent is thick, but by the second class youll be able to hear what he is saying with no problem. I learned quite a bit in his class, and I am a better programmer because of it. Definitely take any class he teaches, you wont be disappointed., what is wrong with this guy? he thinks that his class is the only one we have.  Homework is too unclear, and his accent makes it really hard to understand, you would think that a teacher that asks so much from his students would at least make an effort to learn proper english. save yourself the pain and bad grade, take someone else., poor instructor, with a terrible accent, I spent a of time trying to understand what he is saying in the class.  I wish I never took his class, Dr. Araya was tres cool. Theres not a single thing wrong with the way this man teaches. Easy A if you know what youre doing when it comes to programming., his exams are very hard...very long projects and assignments which consume a lot of time leaving you with only a few hours if you are taking other subjects, Take him for 151. You will become a better programmer, and will learn alot that you can apply. His assignments are long, but very doable. It is true that his exams are long and difficult, but with the curve, the average can be close to 80%., nice man, tries to help students, reminds me of an eastern version of tom cruise, but very very very hard. exams will drive you insane!!, He is a really bad teacher, with a terrible accent, I spent most of the time trying to understand what he is saying, but I guess thats the case with most of the computer science teachers at SJSU, his assingments are too hard and unclear.  Save yourself the F and dont take this teacher., Way too much work for the homework, it only counts as 20-30 percent of your grade but you spend most of your time doing it, its only a 3 unit class so homework is not proportional. Has a really thick accent so is really hard to understand, needs to improve his english.  Homework is never clear., Poor instructor. Never in office hours. Never responds to emails. Programming assignments have too many contradictions, almost like he doesn\t know how to program. Some lectures begin with what would you like to know today.. Always gotten A\s but sensing a poor grade from him. don\t take. Nice guy, He only uses his test case to test your programs, so some people cheat on their programs. He not really know program well. I think he is suck at writing a program. Even he knows, but he will take a long time. He need upgrade himself.COME ON CS., He is hard in cs160. if your group has 2 persons, try to work hard. his projects and final exam will kill you., very friendly person, considerate. knows his subject well . assignments are well thought of and graded liniently and fairly . exams dont kill you. youll learn from this course ., excellent knowledge. great handouts. challenging assignments that dont kill you. considerate and kind man . you learn a lot from him and never feel humiliated . start his homework on time though...like i said it is challenging ., nice man, clear lecture, easy on the grade, Very well organized.  Sometimes a little vague and sometimes too clear (helping with programs =)).  Over all good teacher, Great teacher, very organized, has his own style of teaching which requires students to adjust. Wonderfully kind and understanding, supports students 100%, listens to students carefully which is a rare feature in this dept., Assignments are hard. But he is a verynice instructor. Will explain you and help you work through the problems., One of the better CS teachers at SJSU.  He will help you if you dont understand the material very well and not belittle you like other professors.  Work is graded generously but takes a long time to do.  Make sure you start the programs early!, I thought the overheads were clear and his lectures were informative.  You can learn a lot, if you put in the effort,  that will help you throughout the rest of  your programming classes. Start his programs right away!, Goes through overhead very quickly. Assignments are harder than average but not too bad. Tests are hard, too. But gives a lot of good grades in the end. I would recommend him., Hard to take notes in his class sometimes because he just goes through overheads. Prog. assignments are pretty long, but he gives you plenty of time to do them and helps you along the way. Tests are also long, but are graded easy as with the hw., Tests have hard questions, but are graded very leniently. Homework is ridiculously long, sometimes very hard (graded easy) ... will gain a lot of experience simply surviving this class ..."
Nada Attar,/professor/2445092,2.4,34%,3.4,"If you can afford to wait another semester to graduate then take this class if not then look for another professor, Professor was very helpful and thorough in her lectures, always willing to help out when asked and gave great in class exercises that helped us excel in the exams., If you can take another DSA class, you should because the lectures, homework, quizzes, and exams are not related or helpful. I hope that I didnt take her class. Her lectures are not relevant to what will be tested., Extremely poor teacher, does not teach you how to apply concepts and does not seem to fully understand topics that she is teaching. Despite previous reviews claiming a caring experience I wish that I did not take this class as this was far from my experience. Take any other section unless you are fine with learning everything from YouTube, You learn more and understand better just by google search or from one of those DSA websites.\nFor homework, she will sometime just throw you a coding question and youre on your own.\nFor exams, wording are confusing that you might miss some free questions.\nHer lecture are slight useful in exams but not so much on homework. Quizzes are fairly easy., Worst professor in the whole CS department. She doesnt even know the concepts.\nDont take her even if you delay your graduation., You will spend more time trying to understand what a problem is asking than solving them., Take literally any other section. She turns concepts that could be explained in ~20 minutes into a 1 hour and 15 minute meandering that will leave you more confused than when you started. Homework and exams are riddled with confusing language and incomplete info. Completely theory focused, you will not be taught how to code anything that is covered, Professor is nice but lectures can be confusing. HW and exams are very difficult. Problems can take a while to solve because of the difficulty. Beware to never contact her through email, she never replied back regarding my final grade. Go to her office hours if you need anything., You wont understand anything in class, rely on Youtube university. Useless lectures, not at all helpful for you to understand the DSA concepts. Harsh grades, losing one mark in exam is like losing 1 percent. Dont take this course with this professor. Despite of bad reviews in RMP, I made the biggest mistake to take this with her., Plenty of homework. Lectures were sometimes unclear. Exams were tough but if you do the readings (not required) and rewatch lectures, it will help a lot, Nada is a good professor. She cares about her student and takes feedback very seriously. Her lectures are confusing sometimes and some hw are difficult, Dr. Attar is a very nice and patient professor. She tries her best to help the students learn. However, at times she gets the facts wrong during lectures. Homework could expect you to know more than what was covered in the lecture. Tests also can get tougher than the material covered but she curves them. Go to office hours, work hard, and practice!, She does not care about the students and the whole class is not transparent. You cant see what you did wrong for the final, so basically, you have to accept whatever she gives you on the final. She already had 1 question wrongly graded for my exam1. So you never know if she makes a mistake on the final as well., She explains topics clearly and her slides are straightforward. But HW is much harder than lecture examples, OH only somewhat helps, and tests are easy. This class isnt difficult, you can get an A in this class rather easily. But I wouldnt say I left this class feeling confident about CS 146, so if youre in it for the grade, go for it I guess., Nada is a great professor. Good lectures and she prepares you well for the exams. She is very kind and wants to help you succeed. She takes feedback from students and improves her class in real time. Ive really enjoyed her class and would gladly take more from her in the future., Nada is kind of a nice instructor, but her class structure was bad. Her lecture slides are unprofessional, and the hw does not prep well for quizzes. It was ridiculous to make quizzes 40% and homework 30%. If you do bad on one quiz or more. The more difficulty to be able to pass the class. She kind of frustrated me., Like other reviews, Nada didnt do good as a teacher but partly cuz it was asynchronous and she didnt communicate back to us clearly. Most times ur better off self-learning, lectures usually didnt explain well. Tests had some surprises. Took weeks to grade. Tho I will say the tests and hws are not that hard if you understand the material., She doesnt really teach the subject well and you really need to know this stuff in the future., Professor Attar is not good at teaching. She does not seem to prepare for the class or understand the material or care - most explanations seems memorized or read off a slide. Office hours are useless. I am not sure why she is assigned to teach these key courses. Do avoid her classes., Ive never left a review before, but professor Attar was so bad that I felt I needed to warn anyone that might take her in the future. She didnt seem to know the material well, her quizzes/homeworks were often on topics not covered in class or the textbook, very harsh grading, took over a month to grade stuff, and not helpful during office hours., Absolute garbage class., Absolutely terrible experience with the professor. The lectures fell behind my an entire month leaving us with no time to study. She also changed the format of exam halfway through because she suspected some students were cheating disregarding syllabus. Homework and projects were meaningless for the final as questions were completely different, Its my first time writing a bad review. Attar is the most terrible prof I have ever known. She doesnt prepare her lectures in advance. Her office hours arent helpful cuz she doesnt know the materials well. We fall behind the syllabus like 2-3 weeks after the 1st midterm. She doesnt stick with the syllabus nor explain why., Not very responsive. Dont expect replies back until 2 weeks later or never at all(in my case). Other than that, easy A class. I didnt watch any of her lectures but still managed an A the whole time. Better off watching youtube videos on the content because her lecture videos are her reading off of Princeton slides., Most Professors at SJSU are either neutral or good. Attar is absolute trash (at least for CS146) and she has no idea about the concepts she is teaching. Most of the time, I learned through the online Coursera course taught by the Princeton Professors who wrote Algorithms 4th edition. Also, she said the test is Open note and said students cheated xd, Projects and hw assignments did not prepare you for the exam. Lectures also dont help as she just reads from the slides and isnt that engaged with the material. Apart from this she takes forever to grade material and releases the midterm study guides at the last minutes. Exams may have questions beyond the scope of the class., Projects and hw assignments were fun and all until I realized they do not prepare you for the exam. A one question quiz brought my grade down almost 15%. Exams have lockdown browser although it is open note, and you cannot go back to see the previous question. You can stay on top of everything and still fear not passing the class., As a transfer and I was afraid CS courses here would be tough and exhausting, but Professor Attar taught at a really good pace. Shes caring and tries to do live sessions so students can interact even though the class is asynchronous. Only downside is that sometimes she makes mistakes on things. Lenient grader and fairly easy tests, would recommend, Professor Nattar is super nice and caring of students but her class is definitely disorganized. Very few assignments compared to the other CS146 professors from what Ive heard which can be good or bad depending on how much you invest outside of the lectures. Wouldnt recommend if youre not motivated to learn data structures on your own., Professor Nada is one of the most sweetest professor Ive had; shes always willing to help you in need (go to her office hours) and shell explain it if you dont understand in lecture :D. Very nice and down to earth person, Professor Nada was one of the most genuine and nicest professors Ive had so far. I think the reason most people did not enjoy her class was because the lectures were not as engaging as compared to CS46A. However, her class was extremely straight forward in terms of the materials we learned and I can definitely say she did a great job. Very kind!, Its very easy to lose interest in lectures but slides are online so you can go through them again. Do all your homework because thats a huge portion of your grade and extra credit really helps. You need to create a huge buffer because the study guide didnt help much on what the final contains. Main point: Do all homework and do well on midterms, The professor isnt that bad if you are able to grasp the concepts in her lecture. However, sometimes, lectures are overly stretched sometimes only briefly touched. Homework is important. The final was rather more difficult than what was provided on the study guide, so better give yourself a buffer (do well in 8 HWs and the 2 midterms)., Please take this class when offered by a different professor. Nada does not seem to understand the material she is teaching. The lectures are long and tedious when a google search reveals a simpler more elegant explanation. Her lectures are monotonous and seems memorized., If youre signed up to take a class with Nada, withdraw now and find a different teacher. First of all she is quieter than a newborn mouse, and has mic issues every class. Second her way of teaching ideas is extremely dragged out and unnecessary. Her homework assignment explanations are very confusing. And to top it off our midterm was on paper., She does not even consider situations of people and her grading is arbitrary. She does not have a clear explanation of her grading scheme., Lecture are very clear . Easy A if you attend her classes and do all the assignments (4 to 5 assignments). She is very friendly and makes effort to clear students doubts., Shes a very cool professor with a a dark sense of humor. Her class in general is pretty chill and shes very passionate in what she does. It was her first time lecturing at my university and for her first semester she did an exceptional job."
Kaushik Patra,/professor/1977127,2.3,29%,4.3,"I had to take CS147, and he was the only option. His lectures are boring and very outdated. He gives you labs and projects, and you have to rely on his slides and lectures to complete those. I struggled with them because his teaching methods are one of the worst Ive seen. It feels that rather than teaching, hes here to collect his paycheck., One of the most incompetent professors I have ever had. Hes not good at giving lectures and has a flipped classroom style of teaching, so you have to watch every lecture before class. Has very specific requirements for labs but never mentions them unless he is asked directly. Will mark you for a zero unless you follow said requirements., Hes not that good at giving lectures and most lectures are student-led for extra credit. Exams can be pretty confusing. However, he makes it pretty easy to pass the class considering the extra credit opportunities and the quizzes / assignments weighing more than the midterm and final., Patra has a flipped class format where you watch the lectures (recorded years ago & questionable quality) before you attend the class, where the same info is regurgitated by students teaching for extra credit. 90% of classes were student-led because Patra is lazy. He was a terrible teacher and I didnt learn but at least he was generous with EC., The material in this class is different. To succeed, you need to stay ahead of the lecture material in class through videos. Hes really helpful in office hours if youre ever confused, most people dont go and get behind the class lecture. Take good notes & stay ahead of video lectures to get an A. If you fall behind (me), youre toast., Reuses a lot of content so a lot is searchable online. The old recorded lectures arent that great. Show up to designated lecture time for random pop quizzes. Memorize mcqs and study frqs for exams. 1 cheat sheet(front/back) for midterm, 2 for final. The professor knows his stuff, but the content itself can be confusing with his style of teaching., You need to watch videos before each lecture to understand. Sometimes these videos can be over an hour long. As a commuter student, it became almost impossible to stay on top of what was going on. Start the final project early or you will regret it. The best thing about this class was the bonus points you could earn to save your grade., The way the course is structured, you watch the lecture videos for homework and he reviews the material during lecture. He explains the topics very slowly but, it is also thorough so it is ok. If you are on top of the lecture videos and complete the programming assignments, you should be good., flipped lecture style. tells you to watch the material before coming to class, and as material gets more difficult throughout the semester, it becomes difficult. If he went over the material and the examples in lecture, it would be easier for students to understand. Class is not impossible, long as you do everything with the extra credit, Material ramps up in difficulty after the first half, and the flipped lecture style personally was not very helpful to me. Theres a few coding assignments, quizzes, and pop quizzes (extra credit), but as other reviews say the final project is the most time consuming part of this class. Reuses some questions from quizzes on the finals, best of luck, Give out a lot of extra credits, you will get an A if you spend time learning the materials and put efforts to get tons of extra credits he gave, In terms of grades, this class is a very easy A+ class. You will basically automatically get a curve of 5% in the class from bonus points. Even if you arent doing well there is extra credit on the project to further boost your grade. The quality of the videos he provides are not superb, but test questions will almost always be in the videos., Way worse than his 47. 3 projects in Verilog, not enough material to prep for that imo. Midterm and Final are based on quiz questions. This class was 3 units, but it felt like 5 units in all honesty., The subject itself is difficult, and at times his teaching style is questionable. However, theres a lot of extra credit through pop quizzes and participation. 6 quizzes with 2 attempts, midterm and final that are made up of questions from past quizzes, and a project that is actually straightforward IMO, but time-consuming., Incredibly difficult class and the hardest Ive ever taken being a 3rd year CS uni student. DONT PROCRASTINATE ON HIS HOMEWORK. You need every minute. There are a total of 3. Make sure youre comfortable in Verilog or youre screwed. Really nice, caring guy and obviously fully understand this material. It really shows in his explanations & lecture, This teacher singlehanded made me want to switch majors. He pre-records all of his lectures and expects you to watch them BEFORE scheduled class time. Not only do you have to watch the recorded lecture, you also have to sit through his regular class session, which ends up doubling the time spent in lectures. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!, Please avoid if possible, this class is a headache., Heres what you need to know: 1) attendance is mandatory, 2) quizzes and tests are hard, 3) the project will carry your grade, especially if you do the extra credit component of it, 4) he also gives out extra points at the end (based on participation / how much you tried). Not a hard class, just material is poorly explained by confusing style., The professor clearly knows his material well, but in teaching it, its kinda hard for us students to grasps (in terms of concept). Although midterm is probably where many messed up, doing the project well (start early or else) and the final was very lenient. He was also very generous in giving extra points that help boost grades at end of semester, He is not very helpful or approachable. I think he does not like when students ask him for help because it forces him to acknowledge that he is not good at teaching. He simply points to the same diagrams over and over again... Very ineffective, he makes the topic way harder than it has to be., he makes the topic way harder than it has to be by explaining in strange ways, also he is not very helpful. I cant believe they let teachers like this teach at SJSU, he makes everything so stressful, Honestly, he really discourage me to study the course and I have no passion to study the CS147 with him. I prefer to fall his class and take with another professor. Ffs., This is the kind of professor that makes you change your major. His projects and exams are brutal. This class is basically two classes in one. His lectures about hardware require you to watch his lectures online, and the Verilog projects which are worth half your grade arent covered at all in class. Take someone else if you can., Dont take him., Would not recommend. Expect to waste half your day watching his videos WHILE having other classes to worry about. (Fun fact: some of his videos are longer than lecture time!) You need to have some knowledge in the field or else youre lost. Studied a week and went to office hours and still had no idea what to do on midterm. Great guy, bad teacher., He just makes you watch an hour long video each day instead of lecturing in class and whenever you ask him a question, he tells you to look at your notes instead of explaining the concepts. Videos are very boring to watch, no engagement at all. Also, assumes you have a lot of previous knowledge about hardware, making you get lost very quickly., One of the worst classes/teachers Ive ever had. A lot of the questions on his quizzes do NOT reflect things you have learned from the lecture slides/his class and its hard to even find the information online so you can actually understand the question. This class is required so we have to take it but honestly one of my worst experiences ever, One of the hardest classes I ever took. The labs he assigned were incredibly difficult and takes a lot of time. The reviews he gave us for tests were huge and did not help at all. The questions did not pertain to the review at all., A lot of people on here really harpoon on Patra,but hes actually a pretty chill and funny professor, though he does have an accent. He assigns one big project at the end of the semester that is quite time consuming, so make sure you start early. It isnt super hard, but many start too late and complain later that its too hard or there is no time., You have to take his course since he is the only instructor you can choose for CS47. Good luck. I feel K Patra CS47 is MUCH HARDER than David Tylor CS146., As some other people may have mentioned, the hardest thing I struggled with is how abstract the class is. It is a difficult course. Go to office hours when you feel like you dont understand something. Start on the homework and project early too (they boost your grade a lot). You may get low scores but Patra is generous with curves., Patra is an extremely nice dude. My issue is that he cant really close to gap between having the knowledge of the material and being able to teach it to students in an easy manner. I HIGHLY!!! advise you to go to office hours and sit up front. Attendance is taken, he curves very generously, and the material itself is quite different from other CS., Eh pretty decent professor. 2 HW, 1 MT, 1 Project and the final. HWs give you a fair idea of the finals and MT. Project is tough. hes ok, Difficulty through the roof, Patra was a genuinely a really good professor. He clearly understands the material very well. He answers questions well, and is especially helpful in office hours. The project is difficult, so start early. The final is actually ridiculous, while we havent gotten our grades, everyone I talked to thought they had failed it., Took him for CS47 too, this review is for 147. This is a very difficult class, and you will learn a lot. He is a great teacher and knows his stuff inside and out. Youll be fine if you go to class often and stay on the same page as him. Ask questions if youre unsure, otherwise youll be really really lost. Overall hard class but good teacher, Patra will challenge you but you will learn. The homeworks and projects (especially the projects) are very difficult but if you can suffer through them, you will have a deep understanding of the material that you couldnt possibly get by just listening to / reading the lectures. You cant put off projects to the last minute in this class!!, As long as you read the online lectures before coming to class as well as reviewing after, you should understand the materials well. 2 homework (20%), 8 programming assignments (10%), 20% project which should be doable as long as you follow his guidelines. 1 midterm (20%) and 1 final (30%, great curve). He offered extra credit in the final"
Thaddeus Aid,/professor/2132848,4.4,85%,2.9,"1 of my most fav classes ever. For a dry subject, I ended up enjoying the topic and learned a lot. Very accessible & provides advice about the industry/jobs. He also includes diversity in his lectures, so you learn about more than just computability. Not a hard class when you attend the lectures - he explains things very well., CS154 is a boring yet important class and Thaddeus even admits that. He teaches the class like its your friend teaching you. Tends to ramble on into tangents during lecture, but is willing to go to any extent to help you outside of class. Gave clear summaries of what to expect on exams. Gave a take home final and a class pizza/movie night instead!, Thaddeus is a really good professor and a great person. He goes off topic during lectures, but his tangents are also something interesting to learn from as well. Easy grader, and homework is lighter than other Computer Science classes. Hes really passionate about teaching his students. He cares a lot about what he does and shows it., Its not easy to find a professor who is relate-able to students, but Thaddeus is down to earth and chill (he games you can add him on Steam). I had to commute a lot for my classes at another school and he was very understanding.   Content is mostly theory based with a coding project at the end. We go over complexity theory which is interesting, He is a nice person, although I dont really like his teaching style. CS154 is a hard class to teach and according to what I heard from other sections, this is your best choice. Although you should still learn the most part by yourself., Awesome teacher Gave us pizza.. Lectures off topic sometimes but its still interesting. Would take again., Professor Aid is very passionate about CS and teaches his life experiences to become successful in the field. He is up to date with current technologies and motivates his students to be excited in CS. Take Aid for CS 154 at all costs because the difference of professor Aid or professor Taylor is whether you will pass or fail. I know by experience., First professor to be understanding of what being a student is like. Lectures pair with the homework/test, so its helpful to pay attention. Straight forward grader.  Connects alot of what we do in class to the real world and tried to make sure everyone understands what is being taught., Professor Aid is an awesome professor. He is passionate for technology and it shows. Every class will begin with a tangent about current technology or how to improve your career as a computer scientist. All of his assignments are essay based and attending lecture is mandatory if you want to have an easy time otherwise start googling!, Professor Aid is clearly passionate about Computer Science, and his passion and interest for all things tech and science shines through and makes his lectures genuinely enjoyable. Highly recommended., He is a great Prof. I love what he teaches. Assignments are little hard, but You will learn a lot from them. Midterm and Final are straightforward to what he mentions., Took CS 152 over the summer.  Essay heavy - 1500 words for some, 3000 for others, not impossible, not a strict minimum more of a guideline.  If you can communicate the concepts succinctly in less thats fine unless youre going for a max grade perfect A.  Tests depend on your class - he lets you have a say in their design/difficulty.  Solid choice., Very laid back dude. He does a surprising amount of papers for a CS class, so I hope you like writing. His grading is pretty lax, and if you put in some effort its fairly easy to get a B or C on the hw or midterm., Cool guy, in touch with stuff. Into nerd communities. Grades hard on essays, easy on tests. Will usually grant extensions if class asks. Asks class for input on what should be graded/judged on finals or taken into account on papers. Fun dude., Very cool professors, tests are hard but he gives you option to redo for half points., A really good Professor.  The assignments are pretty straightforward.  Would definitely recommend him., Gives you chocolate if he doesnt grade your assignment on time, major plus., We had one long Saturday afternoon class, and hell usually go through 3-4 slide decks a class so its very information heavy. Hes very generous with midterms, provided you know the topic well. For homework, be prepared to do a lot of outside research because the specs are broad. Just give him honest feedback on how he teaches and youll do good., I am a visual learner, so I hope that he could do more on the whiteboard. Although the lecture is really hard to understand, he tried his best to get his students to learn. His grading is super fair. He understood that everyone struggled, so more points were given if you showed him that you worked hard in class., Profesor Aid is a high energy teacher that is very approachable and tells great stories."
Katerina Potika,/professor/2099184,3.4,50%,3.4,"Really lecture focused, takes participation with pollev and class is kind of boring. Homework assignments that are confusing/already coded for you? Not a huge fan of her but the class is doable, only recommend if you have a heavy interest. Shes a nice enough person, just not a great teacher imo., Dr. Potika is friendly and caring. I would say out of the 146 professors(I took this course when she taught it, not this sem) I felt that she cared about us and wanted us to learn the material. Take her if you want to both learn and feel like youre supported - which these things are critical in a difficult course like CS 146., Potika is one of the few professor I would like to sit down and have a coffee with. Shes very passionate about Social Networks and her passion can be felt. She can crack a few good jokes as well. My only criticism would be her power points are not very thorough., Take this professor/class combo if you dont want to learn anything and get an easy A+. Most confusing teacher I had throughout college. Was not interested in teaching the class, constantly changed rubrics, extremely disorganized., You could kinda tell Potika wasnt crazy passionate about teaching this class, but I cant blame her given everythings online. Super nice albeit a tad disorganized at times (but again, cant blame her too much). Take full advantage of the cheat sheet(s) she allows on exams: Im talking 7 pt font and fitting every detail of her PPT slides on there., 4 projects which werent horrible as long as you start early; you just apply algorithms you learned in class. Midterm and final were fairly difficult so study extra hard. There is a participation grade, so make sure you ask questions in lecture or on Piazza. Subject itself is difficult even if you take with other professors, so self study a lot., With the semester coming to an end(1 week left). She gave us a project due before the final. Did she expect us to not study for the final and just worry about the project? Her lecture is very rush, she speed through many concept and expect us to understand it by the next lecture. Most of the time she will only explain half the class example., She is by far the weirdest yet to say the most ridiculous professor I have ever taken. She makes everything so complicated for her students. Her lectures are not intuitive, canvas is such a mess. I cant understand her teaching style to be honest. Yet, I would still have to try to pass this class. Meh..., Sweet and caring prof overall. Lectures are meh and disorganized and she went thru some material too fast. Projects are long and time-consuming so start early. Project instructions are unclear and confusing so get clarification asap. Weird and inconsistent grading on projects (esp. the 1st one). Expect some typos and incorrect answers on quizzes., Potikas a very sweet professor. She gives detailed lectures thatre fun, but also break down the concepts in clear, succinct ways. Exams are based off past ones. Projects are time consuming, but worth the trouble. Do the HW (even if not graded), study the old exams, and youll be able to succeed in this course., By far the least rigorous professor for 146. Exams are very similar to previous ones she gives. Programming assignments(3-4) arent too bad and dont change too often during semesters. Pay attention in class and do the hw and make sure you know the practice exams really well. Averages were pretty high (78, a B- with her grading scale) 65 for a C-, Easily one of the best 146 instructors at SJSU. Pretty good lectures that are worth your time, a lot of the test questions are pulled directly from lecture slides. 2 Midterms, 1 Final, 4 Projects. Exams were more than fair and projects were challenging but doable. I would highly recommend her., Unorganized way of teaching. Assignment schedule was so unorganized that we had assignments due until the final exam date. Lectures were confusing. Professor never replies to emails. She takes too long to grade homework that one forgets what the homework was about. Do not expect any help with selecting project topic or project related queries., Potika is a really sweet professor. Shes pretty funny too and shes willing to help anyone who needs it. The class itself isnt bad, the homework isnt graded, and attendance isnt required. Potika will explain concepts very well and I recommend taking her. The exams itself are pretty fair, but they do test if you really understand the topics., Easy class. Hilarious Professor. Good teacher. Clear grading criteria. One of my favorite professors at San Jose State., She is kind in grading tests and assignments, Her lectures are amazing, CS 146 is a pretty difficult class with anyone, but her lectures help you in understanding the conceptual stuff more easily. Her projects took hella long so start that stuff early. Optional hw is optional (doesnt hurt to try some of them). Exams are notoriously bad in every CS 146 class, its just less so here so study pseudocode and concepts., Shes alright. Lectures are not as structured and clear as you might expect them from a college professor, but as long as you are focused during class you have a good chance of passing. Definitely not an easy A, but compared to Taylor you have to work less to pass, but might not learn as much. Probably wouldnt take her again., Unorganized way of teaching and confusing lectures. I would prefer to take professor Lin over her. Doesnt grade homework, doesnt  even check them. Dont expect any help in your projects."
Walter Kirchherr,/professor/100287,3.2,N/A,3.7,"This teacher expects waaaaaaaaaaaay too much. Not only do you not know what you are getting throughout the semester, he just murmurs throughout the whole time. I had to take a class, and this was the only one that would fit in my schedule. Avoid at ALL costs. He was okay as far as CS140, There is no book for this class, just online notes, so you save money. Notes and lectures are clear and easy to understand. Lectures are boring, you can skip them and read the online notes. Do the homework, read the notes, and youll learn a lot and will be prepared for the tests.  I got docked for stupid mistakes, watch out for those in assembly!, Very boring lecturer. Hand writing are so small and so hard to read. Test are really hard. You learn mostly assembly language in this class, Not alot of C. Never saw him smile,not even once even when he throws a joke he just grin a little..very boring guy., Tough on grading assignments, but clear and reasonable overall.  Be darned sure youre OK on discrete math beforehand--youll need it.  Also, hes one of the few profs in the department that tightly enforces prereqs--make sure youve done a transfer equivalency with Rocio Avila beforehand if youre a transfer student!, Lectures are a little dry but are very helpful in the overall nature of the course. Homework is right from the lecture notes, which is also the course textbook for the class.\n \n 3 assembly programs and 2 C programs. Grading is fairly leniant for both homework and tests. Would take again in the future., Make sure you sit in the FRONT seat. Or you will have a hard time reading his handwriting. Also, you must do your projects PERFECTLY, or the grader(not the instructor) will take off a lot of points as he like. I do not recommend taking this teacher unless youre sure that youre a GOOD programmer., Thought he was great.  Always started lecture with mini-review of previous one - very helpful.  Consistent in notation and presentation.  Seemed to have deep knowledge of the subject.  Tests were *hard*, but curved generously.  Was not very flexible, but willing to correct mistakes.  Writes *very* fast - tough to keep up. Would take again., I got an A, but it wasnt easy. His lectures can be long and boring, but they are vital in order to succeed in his class. Overall, he is a nice guy, but he can be a pretty tough grader. Small mistakes on an exam or assignment can cost you a few percent. Follow instructions and dont procrastinate on the projects and you will do fine., Follow his directions extremely close. I did an assignment that required color change, but because my color didn\t *fade* as he showed in his example, he took 40% off!, He was not very enthusiastic about the material and never related the material to real life examples. Boring lecturer., This guy might have some knowledge about the subject he teaches, but he definitely show no interest of sharing it with the students. Very crapy teacher!  Try some other professors, because you not going to learn anything in his class!!!, Do not take him for upper division courses. His programming knowledge is limited. he doesnt know much about computers. Every class just reads the book out loud and demands memorization of the entire book (pictures, entire javadoc hierarchy). Wont give you any info besides reading the book in class, Very good lecturer.  Is well prepared and tests are fair.  No book for the class because all the material is on his website which is great.  Gives good explainations and answers questions.  The best professor in CS so far., do not take his class if you can avoid it, Excellent communicator.  No suprises on tests. Having taken other Profs for this class found him a relief.  Good technique for teaching material., has a wide and deep pool of knowledge.  take him if you get a chance -- you are bound to learn something., Excellent lecturer, tends to be very methodical and goes at a slower pace.Tests were straight forware except for his thought questions which were a bit twisted.You can get an A from him as he curves.He is also approachable about questions and, What a jerk for giving Fs for anyone who doesnt have an average of 75% or higher on the 2 midterms and final.  He doesnt care..his class is survival of the fittest!, Good lecturer, clearly states what is covered in the class. A good background in Discrete Math really helps. Tests are a little tricky, but he curves."
Yulia Newton,/professor/2599405,4.7,95%,1.8,"Take her if you can. Thats all Ill say. Light work. Easiest CS class imo., Awesome professor and an easy class. You use existing libraries like sklearn instead of coding AI algorithms from scratch. Homework isnt hard at all as she provides many helpful code examples. Actually encourages you to use Google if youre not sure how to code something. Yulia was always willing to stay after class to answer any questions I had., Class is super easy. Attendance is not mandatory. Quizzes, midterm, and final are all open note. Homework isnt too bad, theres just a lot., Yulia Newton is the Greatest Of All Time, I highly recommend taking her classes, you will learn a lot. She answers all of your questions and cares about her students., One of the best CS professors at SJSU. She posts all homework assignments during the start of the semester so we can finish them all up early if we want. Responds fast to emails. Exams are fairly easy and open book. A few quizzes posted after some classes that we can take on our own time. Very caring and patient professor., She is one of the best CS Professors at SJSU. I wished I took some other classes with her too. I am very thankful for taking her as our project advisor for the Software Engineering Senior Design project. If you have a chance to take her for your required or elective classes, take her!, Great professor, her classes are pretty easy so its an easy A. Shes a very popular choice because of this. I would say if u learn better by being challenged then choose a diff professor. Otherwise, pick this prof for a chill time! (~8 Quizzes, 5 HWs, 2 Midterms, 1 Final), This semester hasnt ended yet. But I really love, love this professor. She is the most patient, logical, thoughtful and nice professor I have ever met in SJSU. As a student mom with two kids, time is always limited. She went out of her way to set up extra office hour with me and helped with the unclear parts I had. Cant appreciate more., Professor Newton is one of the best teachers Ive taken. Clear grading criteria with not many assignments given. She posts the whole semesters homework at the beginning of the semester so you can get it all done early if you want. Exams are open note and contain multiple choice and a few short answer questions. Very helpful and patient teacher., The professor is easy, perhaps too easy. If you would like to coast through one of the most industry-relevant class, do take it and get an easy A. Yeah, you will get the A, but you wont really learn anything (wont learn much beyond a very surface understanding)., The BEST in the business period. the easiest A+ you can ever ask for. and the best part is she teaches like really freakin well. So, its a win-win for students. quizzes, exams, final everything is open all day to take at anytime. literally the most chill prof on campus. you have to take her atleast once if youre a CS major. worth every cent!, Best CS professor at SJSU. She gives you maximum flexibility with online exams and finals (even for in-person classes). Always take her if you can!, The only downside is how easy this class was. It was hard to motivate myself to learn when I knew in the back of my head that the final could be taken with 20 minutes of skimming notes. That said, you get what you put into the class since you have the freedom to choose your final projects topic., Incredible teacher. The only downside is that her lectures a little dry but she covers the material very thoroughly as its very hard. Homework and quizzes are short and very straightforward (she gives you existing code references too!) midterm/final open notes. Shes very friendly in office hours too., Prof. Newton is amazing! Super caring and acknowledges that a lot of coding is just googling how things work. Took her for CS 151 & CS 156. All quizzes, tests, and homework are open book, open note, open internet, just dont cheat with your friends. If you put in the small amount of work required, you will get an A. I slacked off and still got a B!, Midterm and final were open-note, so they werent that bad. Plus you get a whole day to work on them. Quizzes after each lecture module, which are also open-note and get unlimited time to do them until the due date. HW takes around 1 to 3 hours to do, but theyre not mentally tasking. Would definitely recommend!, Probably the only CS prof that has good communication w students. Her quizzes are all based off her slides. If you do the assignments and quizzes, the exam is a breeze. She is a fair grader and is always free to discuss any questions or issues. Prof Newton is angel sent down from heaven., Amazing professor. Was always ready to help even outside of office hours. Makes class easy., Prof. Newton is new to teaching, so her lectures can be dreary; on the bright side, her slides are very thorough, so you can understand the topics just by reading them. Tests, quizzes, and even exams are open notes and open Internet, so theyre easy enough. I recommend actually putting in effort into the homework, as it helped me grasp concepts."
Kevin Smith,/professor/2285135,4.2,77%,3.2,"Nice human being, professor Smith is really knowledgeable in gaming industry. Class was project heavy, all projects/labs were take home, giving enough time. However, if you dont know C++, this class can prove troublesome for you. Some projects gave lot of stress, but key was to start early., Project heavy with elementary C++ and 3D modeling (can solo or duo). By far, one of the easier upper div CS courses, and its a lot of fun. Literally just follow rubric requirements & youll get an A; hes a lenient grader & understanding. Everything is take-home & provides starter code. Attendance isnt necessary if you can reverse engineer code., C++ heavy class, no exams, only coding projects. Clear lectures, you need to know a little basic calculus and physics. The professor is very kind, attend his office hours if you need help. You complete labs that lead up to a 2D game and a 3D game. If you have the time, definitely take it, it is my favorite CS elective at SJSU!, Best to have a basic foundation of C++ and some physics and math for this class. Grades are graded based on coding assignments/projects. Professor is helpful with questions and accessible outside of class. Lecture introduces various game elements and HW implements those elements as practice. Class goes over 2D and 3D game development/modeling., I took CS116A,CS116B, and CS134 with Kevin. I can tell Kevin has a really good understanding about material that he is teaching. Your grade base on projects and exams, which are likely a take home Project. I definitely recommend people, who are interested in gaming and graphic filed, taking class with him. You will not regret!, An interesting CS course, dont think the skills will translate though if you arent planning to work on the graphic/gaming industry. Professor Smith is a nice guy and knows a lot. Responds to my email at a fast rate and with a professional manner. Grading is lenient. Take this course if you are looking to fill in a not-too-hard elective., I had Professor Smith for CS 134 and CS 116A/116B. You can tell he is very passionate about the topics he teaches. I had to take all of his classes online due to COVID, so unfortunately, I would zone out a lot during his lectures. I had to teach myself outside of class how to do the assignments because I got bored during the lectures., I took him for both CS 116A and CS 134. Professor Smiths approach is hands on, so there are a lot of programming projects. Both courses were a lot of work, but fun. Deadlines were generally reasonable, with only a few needing to be adjusted. Overall a very good professor. Most people struggle with the language (C++) so Id practice before taking., The class requires you to do a lot of self-learning and online research, and since this is a new topic I feel like this class is a little hard and can be confusing. This is just Intro to CG btw. I dont feel inspirational for graphics from this class. However, Kevin Smith is very caring and responsive thru email and office hours, so thats good., Kevins class is disorganized. He thinks up new homework on a random basis and changes plans for the class often. The rubric his grader grades with doesnt match the initial assignment. A lot of the information in his lecture is inaccurate. If you know C++ the class wont be difficult but the constant uncertainty will be stressful., Professor Smith is the best CS professor. He has a lot of experience in the game industry and he is supeeer helpful. If you dont understand something, you have to ask him to clarify that. Homework contains projects and in class assignments., Prof. Kevin Smith is really a go-to-professor and will put in hours to help you out. The assignments do require work but are really interesting. This course really helped me to gain confidence in UI/UX skills & I was able to target full-stack domain opportunities. Coursework is broad with areas from 2D to VR. Prof has a lot of experience in field., Course content is broad, you will get an overview of UI Design. Assignments are fun..."
Prateek Jain,/professor/2813873,2.0,25%,3.6,"he should be fired. unclear grading rubric, uses old semester dates. never responds to email, then dont become a professor, if you can not reply in a timely way. if you submit work late, his policy online says he has a grace period, makes up his own rules and decides no more grace policy. only 4 assignments in the grade book, worst professor ever, Expect to learn almost everything on your own. Video lessons only teach the basics of what is asked, if you want to finish the assignments, you need to learn outside from the course itself. Unfortunately contact is nearly nonexistent as well since he does not respond at a reasonable time. \n\nOnly take the course for the requirement, otherwise avoid., I took his 140 class and his 20B class, I dont agree with the rest of the posters here. However, I understand he changed his course structure for 140 recently, which worked great for me at least. He was straightforward and his classes and overall he was great- tho not too involved. His lectures provide enough info to work through the assignments., Dr. Jains lecture videos were informative., Lectures are extremely bare bones and have nothing to do with the homework. Had to spend most of the time learning it by myself on w3schools. Not sure if he knows that hes teaching a beginner class? Assignments kind of feel like asking an 8th grader to do 11th grade math., Professor fails to teach the necessary information that would help a student whos not experienced with Python in succeeding in his class., Not good. The professor doesnt teach the subject matter, then assigns nearly-impossible assignments. Seems to think students have much more background in the subject area than they do. Tons of students dropped out of this class, including myself. One of the most upsetting college experiences Ive had., Had a lot of hmwk and it was hard to keep up, especially cause most of the time he didnt explain in lecture. Had to search up the information online and he accused me of plagiarizing. Not sure how he expected us to know how to write code if he didnt explain it in his lectures. He stopped replying to emails so I had to drop and take coursera"
Joel Frank,/professor/1216631,3.4,100%,2.9,"Took him twice for AASB & AASA. Super funny guy, he is super passionate about Asian American Studies. He gives freebie assignments worth 1pt summarizing lectures he explained in class. Hes a lenient grader and hardly fails any students. His lectures are interesting since he summarizes them and makes them easier to understand. WOULD TAKE AGAIN!!!, Took him with Choi; definitely the easier grader. Bland lectures but he knows his stuff. Go into his office hours for help with the essay; hell show you which direction hell want you to head. Also, his exams are all short+long answers, so prepare to write., I found him hard at first, but now that Im in 46B I am so glad that I had him for a prof.  I am light years beyond the others in my class.  I would recommend this prof to anyone who really wants to learn how to code....not for the novice., He is not easy, and talks fast.  However, I am 46B right now, and half of what we are covering right now he covered last semester.  So last semester was rough, but now Im ahead of everyone else this semester., After the 1st test, the exams became all based on definitions, and no programming. He became aware that his teaching style was horrible from poor test performances of all students, and make them drastically easier. The final was a joke. It was pure definitions. Not one single program. Homework assignments did not correlate with lectures. After the, Fall 2008. I think he just got his MS before this semester. Didnt learn anything from him. New teacher, and young. Taking CS 46B right now, and feel so screwed because of him. I learned barely any Java. He talks extremely fast, and is hard to hear what he is saying. (PART 1/2), Professor Franks speaks very fast. He focuses a lot on core concepts and theory rather that the actual syntax. Has exams on paper, no laptops. Exams mostly on concepts, definitions, not syntax or how to code. A very fast paced course. You must also do the advanced windows tutorials. Take him if you are a self-motivated fast learner only."
Ken Tsang,/professor/2778566,5.0,100%,1.7,"Professor Ken is one of the professors that you will never regret taking. He is very nice, and EXTREMELY supportive when you need help. He responds quickly and explains everything just enough to unblockyou. Project is not easy, and you will need to learn new technologies that you have never used before, but he will point you in the right direction., Ken was an amazing professor! His lectures are concise and to the point and everything you need to know for the exams is on the slides. This class is project-based, so every week we have time to work on our projects with our groups in class. Overall, I learned a lot from the project and Ken was always there to help us if we ran into any problems!, Professor Ken is a fantastic person. He cares about each and every student. The class environment is so friendly. You can ask him questions anytime, and he will respond to you. I am happy that I took this class. I learned a lot from the group project. The midterm and final are so easy. For this class, you just need to focus on the project part., Absolutely amazing professor who is very friendly and chill to everybody, and gives students lots of helpful advice. Maintains a positive and lively atmosphere in the classroom, and makes very funny jokes while teaching to keep us engaged. Very supportive as well. I feel that there is no way anyone would be dissatisfied taking his class. Wonderful, Very chill. Grading was based on project, midterm, and final. Show up to class and ask for help, his advice is very helpful, Ken cares for his students and always offered help when students needed. He is also very proficient in web development and always helped students to answer related questions. I had no experience with web development before. Ken even taught me how to debug! Besides the school work, he also gave me career advice., Ken cares very much about his students and is very generous in grading."
Toshi Bhat,/professor/2961937,4.6,100%,3.4,"Had very open-ended homework and quizzes were very easy and usually reviewed in class so you could improve. Final group project was fun. He lectured with slides and it got boring at times, but everything on the quiz was on the lectures., Really nice and caring professor. As a new teacher, he made his midterm way too difficult but made up for it with super nice grading on the group projects, homework, and more fair final. Lectures a bit fast but concepts arent too hard to understand. Would recommend taking him., Pros: Extensive course knowledge, student feedback valued, respectful of time, enthusiastic about learning and participation. Balanced homework difficulty, quantifiable learning outcomes. Really cares about his students success\n\nCons: Lectures occasionally unfocused. Midterm tougher than quizzes. Inconsistent rubric knowledge with assignments., caring professor, always there to help. A lot of knowledge shared and does not mind explaining over and over again until you understand the topic. Hope Toshi continues to teach after his masters as I really admire his dedication to spreading knowledge to the class. Be aware exams are hard as he tests to see the knowledge you have attained., Mr. Bhat provided a lot of extra credit opportunities and was very caring towards all students. The exams were a little difficult, but they were fair. Thank you for the hard work."
Apoorva Mohite,/professor/2967991,3.3,50%,3.3,"Apoorva was ok at teaching. She would explain the concepts somewhat clearly but her content was very dry. Her grading criteria were also extremely vague and harsh, but she loosened up near the end of the semester. She gave a lot of freedom on the group project at the end of the semester and I feel like I learned a lot. Overall just average., Hard to work with: unresponsive to questions or answered with memes or counter-questions instead of helpful answers. Uses test questions like TrickyQuestion and MonsterQuestion designed to stump students. Assignments are vague and graded on a mystery rubric. Defensive when given any feedback. She\s smarter than you and wants you to know. Avoid., Shes a good professor and provides the slides afterwards for all her lectures. I would say the assignments are good practice for programming but her TA is not specific enough on what issues we had in our assignments and seems to be harsh with grading criteria. Nonetheless, she is great and actually wants you to succeed., First time teaching, yet the BEST professor I had last semester. Chill & understanding, open to feedback/suggestions. Responds fast on discord. Lectures: more on theory than application, but helpful for what to focus on for tests. Straightforward weekly quizzes based on slides/lecture. Strict programming assignments. High freedom in group project."
Natalie Linnell,/professor/1663697,4.5,N/A,3,"She is a good teacher. Unlike other teachers who teach that class, she is really helpful and her lectures are organized. Hw is hard, but it is not her fault as Horstmann take care of it. I would definitely recommend this class if you want a helpful teacher., I took User Interface Design-CS235 under Natalie Linnell.A really great professor. One of the few professors at SJSU who takes time to prepare for her class. She is very approachable and helpful. Gives a lot of work and also sufficient time to finish the work. Has organized lecture notes and slides, keeps every class interesting."
Margareta Ackerman,/professor/2207330,5.0,100%,2.5,"The best teacher I have had so far at SJSU. She makes sure that everyone understands the material. She gives reasonable amount of homework, and with more than enough time to complete them. Tests are pretty straight forward., Maya is really good at explaining complicated abstract concepts & gauging the level of her students. She doesnt go too fast or too slow. She makes sure that we understand before she proceeds  & uses different strategies to explain different things, which is very useful. She is very friendly, interactive with students, and passionate about teaching"
Thomas Hilderbrand,/professor/1645607,3.0,100%,4.5,"His assignment and project requirements are very clear. He is great at teaching virtualization technologies . a subject matter expert .., The prof does not have much experience in teaching at an university. Very hard to understand his expectations. If you miss specific keywords in answers, you would not get any credit. Project was for UI design but no emphasis was laid on checking core subject. Poor homework assignment, and grading rules. No one got an A in his class."
Maryam Hasan,/professor/2565932,3.0,0%,4,"Shes new to teaching and inexperienced. Accent hard to listen. Lecture boring and hard to follow. Isnt quite good at helping students questions. Her lecture slides are also tough to study by yourself. Tough grader for homeworks and midterm. Allows cheat sheet for midterm and final so its not hard doing those. No actual coding, just pseudocode."
Yonghwan Lim,/professor/2775841,5.0,100%,2,One of the best professors at SJSU! His CS155 classes were more like a leetcode/hackerrank problem. I thoroughly enjoyed his class and learn a TON of insight into solving data algorithm problems that many tech companies tend to ask in the interview. 11/10 would take again.
Reshaj Maskey,/professor/2820081,5.0,100%,2,"I had the privilege of being in Professor Maskeys class this semester, and it was an incredibly enriching experience. Their passion for the subject is contagious, making complex topics feel approachable and fascinating.

Ahmad Yazdankhah,/professor/1919535,3.7,72%,3.1,"Weekly quizzes online on Friday to recap lectures, 1 project on JFLAP, 2 online tests w/ conceptual/practical portions and 1 online final-mainly on last few weeks of lecture. Quizzes/exams have trick questions (unusual or not basic). Professor is helpful with QUICK grading, discord replies, adjusting deadlines., Expect weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final (all with lockdown browser). Everything you need to study is on the professors lecture slides. Study them well and you will secure an easy A. One term project throughout the semester with a submission of a new requirement each week. Rubrics are clear, follow directions and you will get full points., Class is pretty easy to keep up with, and his lectures are alright. Unfortunately, he has a negative attitude and is hostile toward students and I felt a bit awkward myself with how he talks to us sometimes., The professor is nice and you can tell he cares a lot about CS. 2 Midterms, 1 Final, weekly quizzes on lockdown browser, with all material being from the slides so attendence is optional. The final JavaFX group project was easy and rubric is always extremely clear. 0 homework. Great OOP lessons and slides., great lectures, responds to student questions quickly, passionate about teaching, cares about students. There are weekly quizzes which are pretty manageable, two midterms and a term project. He does a good job of summarizing all the points with examples, terrible professor, ineffective teaching skills, difficult and hard to deal with, I do not understand the negative reviews.Professor wants students to learn the concepts, not memorize them.If you watch his online lectures and practice, you should be good.Attending class is highly recommended because he sometimes goes over some example exercises not done in video lectures.Weekly quizzes,3 exams and a term project. Best professor., really sweet professor. lectures are straightforward + he has video versions so you dont HAVE to attend class, but i def suggest it to meet ppl since theres group coding assignments. weekly quizzes on lockdown browser with similar midterms. just study the slides well and follow his rubric for the coding projects., Although this professor claims he has no tricky questions in his exam,there were few in the recent mid-term. Many students share the same complaint. Tricky questions often lead to selecting both correct and incorrect answers in the multiple-choices part. And either students fail or get lower grades. I liked his lectures but not the quizzes/exams., Harsh grader, rude to students, tricky exams., One of the best professors Ive had. His lectures are clear and easy to understand. He has weekly quizzes. The midterms and finals are in a similar format. If you study the slides, theyll be a breeze. Follow his rubric for group assignments and you wont lose any points., Amazing professor, highly recommended., barley passed. so much weekly homework, teaching is straight forward. Very strict rules. Takes points off for simple things a lot. exam questions are tricky., Amazing instructor! Being taught by someone who is a current working professional in the field with decades of experience is a great opportunity. You will grow so much as a programmer in his class and feel better prepared for interviews. He posts slides and lectures which clear and helpful. Weekly quizzes prepare you for exams. Highly recommend., Definitely one of my favorite CS professors. He makes lectures so interesting and makes you want to learn more. He has weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. Make sure to review the lectures before taking the quizzes and watch his videos on youtube for review., Graded by weekly quizzes, midterms, final project, and final. Trick question everywhere. Lots of students complain about the trick questions but he refuses to acknowledge the complaints, and rather explain how students should know the difference., Teacher got bad compared to a couple of years ago. Trick questions are frequent, even though he prides himself on I don\t give out trick questions. Grade is made up of these weekly quizzes with trick questions which get harder as the semester goes on. Very unreasonable on grading and in Discord. Likes to take off points for small mistakes A LOT., Gets very defensive when students bring up complaints about his quiz questions. Likes to give a lot of trick questions where the intention is to deceive the student into losing a point. He claims he does not give trick questions, but if you ask most of the class they would say that there are many trick questions. I felt uncomfortable in his discord, I didnt put too much effort but the content he teaches is important. You will be fine if you watch lectures., Professor Yazdankhahs class is straightforward and his lectures are decent. However, I do wish he would have a more positive attitude toward his students and be more respectful generally. There have been a couple instances where my classmates have said they felt uncomfortable in his class, and I also do feel uncomfortable when he addresses us., The positive aspect of Professor Ahmads class is its simplicity. \nHowever, notable drawbacks include his reluctance to accept constructive criticism and strict. Another concern is his alleged targeting of students, with reports circulating about instances where he has disrespected and raised his voice at multiple individuals over trivial matters., My experience with this guy was overshadowed by their reluctance to provide constructive feedback on assignments. Despite my efforts to improve, the minimal guidance offered left me feeling uncertain about my academic progress and undermined my motivation to excel in the course., Professor Yazdankhah exhibited a lack of responsiveness to emails and inquiries, making it challenging to get timely answers to important questions. This lack of communication hindered my ability to grasp certain concepts, and it was frustrating to feel overlooked as a student seeking guidance., I recently had a disappointing experience with Professor Ahmad. Despite my attempts to seek help and clarification, they consistently showed a lack of willingness to assist students. This created a challenging learning environment, and I felt unsupported throughout the course., Ahmad was a great professor, but due to certain things happening in Spring 2023, he has adjusted his policies and now every week there is a lockdown quiz. In which you will competing against people who most likely find a way to cheat, so bear that in mind. Also every week there is a quiz and term project assignment, no time to study or relax., In this class, you will probably end up having fun with your new friends after you choose to become part of a project team together and build an interesting project using JavaFX. I use the skills I learned here daily as part of my SWE internship, and I can say I learned a lot of useful things in this class., In Prof. Ahmads class, theres a manageable workload and straightforward teaching. The pros include the ease of the course. Prof also struggles with feedback, maintains strict rules, and students feel disrespected or overly criticized in minor situations with his passive aggressive tone on his class discord., This better not get deleted since Im following the guidelines. Pros of Prof. Ahmad is easy class. Cons is he doesnt take constructive criticism and is overly strict. Another issue is him targeting students, you can ask around and people will tell you that he has disrespected and yelled at multiples students for simple reasons., Watch the lectures(prerecorded) & youll pass easily bc they contain the answer to all questions on his exams. He highlights points that will be tested on and even sometimes straight up tell you a likely question on the next exam. Only issue may be his exams are all cumulative with his midterm/final low on time. Also, get a good team for term proj., Very chill and understanding professor.  Very funny and has good lectures with examples that really help understand stuff.  The term project is a lot of work so a bad team can really hurt you in this class., You will never finish the quizzes and exams within the given time limit. I dont have enough time to finish. The questions were never straightforward. MCQ is tricky sometimes, and the free responses questions is kinda iffy. Also, he never ever turns on his camera but we are forced to turn it on during exam time when already have a lockdown browser., Having taken Professor Yazdankhah for CS 151, 154, and 166, hes an amazing professor. His lectures are well-structured and clear. He provides you with everything you need to know to succeed. The only reason you would struggle is a lack of effort on your part. If you review and understand all of the content hes taught in class, you will do well., Took CS151,152 & 166 with prof Y. Can you tell I love this guy?! Not only an EXCELLENT prof, but also cares about his studs. Puts great effort on his lectures and even tho the courses are challenging by nature, he finds a way to make each topic super clear. I am graduating this sem and  prof Y has been my fave by far and the only prof I will miss., Ahmad is the GOAT, hes my absolute favorite CS professor because he teaches 151 (object oriented programming) so well yet is so caring about his students. His lectures are slow yet fast paced and easy to understand. His term project is highly engaging, challenging in a good way, and a good resume enhancer. I would take him again for another class., The GOAT. Weekly quizzes, really in-depth lectures, no textbook (have to watch video before class, discuss in class), midterm and final were not bad, 1 group project at end. Funny moments in class, can tell he loves to teach and cares for his students, would 100% recommend. Content can be difficult for some but I really enjoyed learning the theory., Ahmad is a gem! Please take him if you can. He makes difficult concepts extremely easy to understand and is a really fast grader as well. Weekly quizzes, just make sure you watch the lecture video. Extremely accommodating Professor as well. A Professor with the biggest heart Ive ever met., The jewel of SJSUs CS department, genuinely has passion for what he teaches. Extremely organized class, as you know how all quizzes, assignments, and exams are graded (he grades very quickly too, as assignment grades come out a few hours after theyre due). He has many interesting anecdotes and is always open to questions. Thank you professor!, One of the kindest and most understanding professors Ive ever had. Posts all of his lectures on Youtube so students can watch whenever we want. Takes time to go through every quiz and answer every question, and put the questions that students made mistake on in the next quiz. I also like his little jokes here and there, quite funny man., One of the best professors in the entire CS Dept. Very caring, very flexible. He was flexible on the dates for the exams, assignments were straight-forward, lectures were funny and informative. Loved it., This was my only class with this professor but I learned a lot and nothing in the class felt like a waste of time. There is a decent bit of homework with a program each week for every cipher system but tools are provided to make it as streamlined as possible. I very much enjoyed the course and would gladly take it again., Honestly one of the best CS classes Ive taken here. Posts videos before class and reviews them during in-person lecture. Super kind and always willing to spend extra time to help you if youre stuck. Towards the end of the semester, he spent hours after lecture helping people debug their final projects. Take him if you can., Good choice! Posts lecture videos beforehand (1 hr long), so you dont need to go to class. Really wants us to ask him questions if were confused. Exams & quizzes are closed-notes and time-crunched (1 min per question). Group project isnt too bad. Never turns his camera on so it was weird when he made us turn them on for exams but he didnt., The guy is funny and nice, but cant teach. Avoid., Professor Yazdankhah is a great professor! Absolutely recommend CS151 with him. His lectures are clear, and the material is engaging. The group project is also interesting (granted you get a good group), and you get to learn a lot., Hes a great professor! Lectures are very straightforward and easy to understand. He also provides videos that are helpful to reference. Quizzes and exams are also straightforward from the lectures. Hes also very open to answering questions students have for him., Quizzes and exams are completely based on the slides. In his lecture videos, he makes everything crystal clear. In class, he goes over any questions students may have (students rarely has questions because videos are super clear so we usually dismiss class early). Highly recommend!, Kind of a strange teacher, but his lectures are amazing! No textbook- the class is based off his slides (which are great). Quizzes and tests are based off slides and lecture. There is 1 semester-long group project. He expects you to show up to every class, and will end class early if he finishes early. Would definitely recommend this Prof.!, Professor Yazdankhah is absolutely hilarious. I wish the quizzes were at least slightly more difficult because they only really tested basic knowledge youd get from skimming slides so it made me a bit lazy when studying, but to each their own. The class is not difficult and Professor Yazdankhah teaches clearly and succinctly., Just take him period, absolutely A M A Z I N G! His class is so enjoyable, his lectures are easy to understand, and you learn a whole lot of concepts that was actually asked in interviews. Youre missing out if you dont get to take his class!!!, Please take his 151 section if its available! Trust me this professor will not disappoint. His quizzes and midterms are based from his lectures., SUCH SUCH SUCH a great professor. Lectures are so good that time actually flies by. Theyre so easy to understand you forget this is an upper div class. Hes always laughing and happy. TAKE HIM!!!, Hes an awesome professor! His quizzes and midterms are heavily based on his lectures so make sure to pay attention. His lectures arent too bad and he explains well. I also heard hes one of the easiest 151 professors compared to others., Group project, guides you through each phase. Quizzes and exams are all in lecture slides (which btw is amazing and concise). I cant ask for a better professor. His lectures are the ones that dont give you stress bc theyre so smooth and well-explained! Take him!, Best CS professor at SJSU hands down! Lectures are CRYSTAL CLEAR bc he spends hours editing them. Work load is very reasonable and reflects lecture. All quiz and exams are pulled directly from lecture. WHAT AN AMAZING PROF!!!!, The class is easy to follow if we pay attention at classes. HWs are related to lecture., Very good teacher who makes you understand the topic in detail with ease., Weekly HWs, a midterm, a term project, and a final are almost all programming assignment in Java using cryptography related utility library. Lectures posted on YouTube are enough to finish programming assignments. Professor is willing to help for HWs and exams. Perfect class for COVID-19 situation - programming focused and clear lectures., Professor Ahmad was one of the best professors I had at SJSU. He really cares about his students. Make sure to really pay attention to the lectures and do the problems he tells you to do at home. There is a quiz every week, but if you understand the lectures, you will do well. Overall, this class wasnt easy, but Professor Ahmad is great!, He has a good personality and he is high in IQ and EQ. He is easy to talk with and his lectures are great. Maybe I felt this class was too easy to study so I did not spend much time on it. As a result, I did badly on the tests. His tests are crazy. The time is not enough to finish all the questions unless you are really familiar I guess., My view of this class may be different from urs bcuz it went online due to Covid 19 (had access to class recordings). Hes good at teaching. But boy, the exams have so many questions for the time given. Making a diagram takes longer online. U use JFLAP, take a screenie, upload to canvas files, embed it. Noticed a mistake on the pic? Repeat that. Ugh, Didnt give a crap about anyones issues transitioning to online during this covid situation. 15% of class wasnt able to finish 2nd midterm and final because of new requirements but still giving the same amount of time as in person exam. Doesnt hold office hours or answer questions. Says post discussion. Overall smartass., This course (formal languages) was surprisingly fun given the subject material. Prof. Yazdankhah is an excellent lecturer, and enjoys engaging with students in the class room. You will need to be on your toes in this course, as he tends to add trick questions on the weekly quizes, but as long as you pay attention youll get an A. Good Professor., Im not gonna lie the class is not easy. No coding in this class, basically we learn about computer machines early in CS history. The material can be hard sometimes, and the class needs stable studying time to follow up every week. The term project is extremely time-consuming and hard. The teachers funny and friendly. Reachable and helpful., 1 Quiz every Thursday, lecture gets boring and easy to be sidetracked, but without attending it can get confusing near the end of the course. Attendance not graded. Ahmad, however, is a super chill and is a funny dude. Dont bother arguing with him however; I promise you will NOT win. Hes a very straightforward guy and VERY clear on instructions, Need at least 13 scantrons throughout the semester for weekly Thursday quizzes. He treats students like dogs and throws candy to students for answering questions or asking decent questions., This is the first ever rating ive ever made and probably my last. But seriously this is the best lecturer on campus - he keeps a pretty mundane subject very interesting and is super interactive with students. One of the best courses ive taken and its because of him. You will not regret taking this class. Make sure to go to every class., He is a really great guy. Absolutely understanding and does his best to make the dry subject engaging. Really wants students to succeed. He brings chocolate and Madeline cookies so thats a bonus. Focus on the slides and take good notes of what he says in class. He gives a decent amount of hints on what will be on the quizzes so dont skip class., Professor Yazdankhah is really the best lecturer to be honest in the CS Department. He explains every concept crystal clearly and his slides are self explanatory. You will find his lectures never boring because he has such a strong sense of humor that he could turn everything mundane into jokes that I would want to laugh about!, So easy, great professor, very friendly and very funny. Take him for 154, I cant imagine him teaching another class., Ahmad is the best professor I have ever had. He makes a great amount of preparation before lecture and thus his lectures are very clear and easy to follow. He is sometimes very funny and frequently gives out chocolate/madeleine for correctly answering/asking questions in his class! I have really learned a lot with him! Taking his class was the best, Best Professor ever!! He loves teaching and helping students. I wish all teachers were like him. This is the only class I feel like going in because professor is so caring and enthusiastic for teaching. Highly recommended. I wish he teaches more classes so I can actually learn something., He LOVES THIS CLASS and you will too if you pay attention. Quiz questions are tricky at first but are weekly and cumulative with repeated questions so you get the hang of it quickly, and you will learn the material thoroughly. His slides make it very clear what you need to know, and his lecturing is entertaining and informative. A+ teacher, I liked his class. Would take him again., He definitely the best teacher I have had so far at this University. He cares more about you growing as a Computer Scientist than you passing the class. Now dont get me wrong he wants you to pass. Going to class is recommended. His lectures are very clear. Quizzes every week. I love this guy., This teacher has weekly quizzes. Most of them are repeats from previous quizzes, with a couple of new from the new material. His classes are interactive and he makes even the most abstract class into a practical class with tangible examples. If youre participating and show him youre using youre head during class you might even get a chocolate ;), Ahmad is a great professor. Ive taken him for both CS 151 and CS 154, and Ive loved his class both times. He gives minimal homework, but gives a fairly easy quiz each week for easy points and memorization, which helps a lot on his tests.   Ahmad is generally just a fun guy, and hes probably my favorite professor at SJSU. Would take again., Lectures slides are easy to understand. He is a fun teacher who rewards student participation in class with chocolate! Weekly quizzes are easy because they are based on his slides and mostly multiple choice. Overall, easy grader, intuitive slides, and easy to get an A while learning key points b/c he repeats quiz questions so it sticks in your head, A pretty easy class. Weekly quizzes, where you memorize some stuff off of lecture powerpoints that he posts up online. Its all conceptual stuff. He can be somewhat disorganized and his test questions/instructions are ambiguous at times . His lectures are interesting enough to keep me awake. Group project is worth a pretty big chunk of grade., This class is a very easy going and clear class. He gives weekly quizzes and honestly even though it sounds brutal, it is very beneficial in the long run. I didnt have to study longer than 30 minutes for the final exams and midterms. Homework was straightforward. Group project wasnt bad either. Lecture slides are straightforward & no book require, The thing that requires the most work for his class is the group project. He may be unorganized at times but I would take him again. I honestly thought I was gonna get a lower grade than what I actually got. He curves fairly. He was a pretty funny guy, get on his good side. Oh yeah and he gives out chocolate sometimes :D, Professor Yazdankhah was a good professor, and Im glad I took CS146 with him. Lectures were very clear. Assignments were challenging, and sometimes vague, but far from impossible. Most of the time the pseudocode was right in the textbook! His on-paper assignments were easy. The final wasnt bad - half of it was open-book! 1010 would take again., Tests are tough. Group projects make up a lot of your grade. Grading criteria isn\t very clear. Won\t assign a grade to your project until you resubmit, but will take off points for resubmission. To tell you the truth, just stay away from this teacher., Fairly easy grader, if you have a good group who understands whats going on because theres only two projects done which is a majority of your grade. Lots of quizzes in the first two months of the semester and it starts dwindling down. Take him if you dont like a lot of work. Hard to understand his lectures., Hes unprepared and grades really toughly. The projects are 60%+ of your grade and he only gives 2 of them. If they dont work EXACTLY as he feels they should work including things that werent in the description of the assignment, then he will mark you down or wont grade your project. Simply put, dont take it with him., terrible professor, he always assume you know everything from the beginning to the end of the chapters without discussing or talking about it in the class, and once he puts a random assignment out of no where on canvas , you would have no idea how to approach it :(, He is not really well-prepared for the class. No homework or assignments whatsoever. When he gave out one, its extremely complicated.   Always assume that students knew what hes talking about already. So whats the point of going to class then?  Occasional grammar mistakes in lecture slides.  I would recommend NOT taking him., Nice guy. Decent teacher. Communication skills could use some work when it comes to assignments. Multiple times he would post an assignment online without mentioning it in class. Maybe I should be better at checking online, but a quick word in class would be appreciated., He expects you to know everything already, thus the extremely difficult assignments, which is worth 100 points :( Skip several parts of lecture. I know some of it is on my, but if I have the chance to go back, Id take it with another professor., Horrible teacher, dont take any computer science class with him. He doesnt give practice problems at all. He expects you to know all the material that is in the book and he has either a quiz or a test every week without giving us any practice problems to study., Awesome Teacher!!!"
Ahmed Ezzat,/professor/1930235,3.2,64%,2.7,"No final exam. A project & presentation for the final. Easy grading.

He makes the class very interesting and I look forward to every class., Great Professor! Every lecture was very clear and easily comprehensible., Concepts are clearly explained. He has a strong grasp of the things he teaches. His lesson is set up in such a way that you are tempted to listen to what he has to say., His teaching style is very effective, and I admire it. He explains complicated subjects in simple terms., He is very clear in his explanation of the subject. I believe the homework assignments were extremely beneficial in helping me learn the material. The teacher was available to answer questions. He was extremely responsive to email questions, which I greatly appreciated., Excellent professor who can clearly explain subjects. Useful assignments and project. If you approach him with questions, he is extremely helpful., Topics he teach are a bit low level in depth, but you can easily learn things. His experience makes the class more interesting. I would recommend you guys to take the class., The lectures he gives and the slides he provides are extremely useful. He records his lectures and uploads them to Canvas. Fantastic professor with great understanding in Databases., Excellent class. I strongly recommend it. Dont miss his lecture. If you have the opportunity to study databases under him, take advantage of it. He has worked for Oracle, and his industry experience is evident in his lectures., I would highly recommend Professor Ezzat. he is highly knowledgeable and strives to give back to the community by teaching. Dont miss an opportunity to take his class., The exams and projects are reasonably challenging and reinforce the concept well. Sufficient time is given to prepare. Professor is always available for any queries we may have., The lectures presented and the slides that he provides are very helpful. Although the lectures are in-person, he records them and uploads to canvas. Amazing professor with good sense of humor., Contrary to popular belief, professor actually encourages asking doubts and clarifies even the smallest ones. Always asks is that clear now and will explain again of not clear. Also says thanks for asking when you ask doubts., Great class. Would highly recommend. Dont miss his class. If you have an opportunity to study databases under him, go for it. He has worked in Oracle and that industry experience shows in his lectures as they are practically tailored to meet the industrial requirements. He also encourages research. AMAZING professor!, one of the few classes in which i actually understood the material. very systematic and helpful professor., Prof. Ezzats class is the one I enjoy most this semester. There is never a dull moment and he connects with all of us so well. It is always a class where learning meets fun. It is the best possible way to learn. \n\nHe encouraged us to ask questions in the very first class and even appreciated me for asking a good question., Disappointing course, Easy pass, go to class. If you skip a quiz, then your grade will be a miss., one of the worst professors I had till date. No clear guidance on the course and no clear teaching of concepts. If students ask questions for clarity, they get yelled at. Overall, not a good experience and best to avoid him if there are other options., Not an easy A, Even though he is experienced, his knowledge of content is nix. Boasts about himself. Making mistakes as a professor isnt wrong, but when students point it out, instead of accepting it, he yells at them. Because of this even the most interested students get demotivated. Overall I will not recommend his class even just for credits, He is not clear explaining material and when you ask questions, he yells at you. Not recommended, Worst professor ever!Avoid if you can! He was very mean and rude to student and screams at us when we ask questions.I was like,Is he really a teacher? Feels like he hate his students so much and I dont think that he should be in a school and try to give students hard time. please, avoid him or your life will be ruin!, Very mean and often talks down to students. His lectures are all over the place. You wont learn anything from him. He doesnt care at all about students. A real disgrace to SJSU., He mumbles without any clarity in his lecture. Very rude and arrogant. Dont expect help. Screams at students if simple questions asked. Please avoid., He has a bad temper and is really annoying. Lectures not clear and confusing. You should ask question but he is sometimes not polite and rude. He does not teach anything in class, so you are on your own with the textbook. Avoid if you can., Ahmed has become a endearing friend to me. I agree with the comments that his lectures can be boring but he makes up for it in his genuine interest for students to learn and pass his course. Not only does he curve he gives exam previews that the questions can be found straight out of the textbook. It is easy to get a good grade in his class., Worst professor ever... Did not learn anything from his class. His lecture is just keeping talking, nothing but windbaggery, and you will never find any relation to the exam. The exam is totally unexpected, even you read the book carefully, reviewed the ppt, but still dont know what is testing and how to answer. Arrogant prof, not care about student, Horrible professor.  He will talk about his past experience at least 3 times per day.  Not great at teaching.  Reads boarding slides every lecture.  Very arrogant.  Not recommended., Ezzat lectures straight out of the book and is very hard to understand. He is quite intimidating and acts arrogant in a way that makes him scary to approach. In addition, he uses a relative grading system and denies people the grades that they have truly earned. Even if he has industry experience, this man is stuck in the past and cant teach well., Prof wont teach anything useful, just  mumbles  without any clarity in his speech. Very rude and arrogant. Yells at students if question asked. No clear grading criteria. Avoid., Dr. Ezzat is extremely knowledgable and genuinely cares about seeing his students succeed. He has a ton of industry experience and so he tries his best to teach content that will be relevant in the real world. He is always approachable, fair with homework load and also fair in grading methods., This guy loves Oracle a lot. His lectures are not interesting. Test questions are very different from the lectures. Be careful. He will talk on and on about things that do not matter and will not show up on the test. He is a sweet guy and he is actually an amazing person. Possibly an amazing boss. But.. not a good professor., Professor is really caring and will go out of his way to help you out! Be ready to study from the study guide and exams are straightforward! He can some times lose patience but he never holds a grudge in any way!, Professor Ezzat is a really good professor! He cares more about students understanding the course material and how to implement what they learned rather than trying to test or pile homework. Exams are fairly easy along with his grading. Homework can be a bit tougher but hes always open to help! Id recommend him!, He may come off as being rude at first but hes a sweet person from the inside, where it counts. If you talk to him individually, he is often very understanding. Lectures have real world examples and exams are not too difficult -- he gives a review sheet which relates closely to the actual exam. Homework can be tough so start early! Good Luck!, Okay, honestly, he does not explain anything properly and then gets mad at students for asking questions, even after he tells us to ask him questions. He yells at students. He gets all his assignments off of professor Mak. I would not recommend him, at all., Horrible professor. Does not teach you anything. He goes over slides taken from random places on the internet. Questions are brushed off. Avoid if you can., Very unhelpful and easily irritated. Lecture notes are blatantly ripped from the book, assignment notes will sometimes not match what he wants us to do or be outdated. While its nice that he has industry experience, he seems a bit stuck in the past, praising himself a lot. Lots of theory, but youll do very little actual coding. Avoid if possible., Awesome Teacher!!!, My first class with this professor and he is very hard to hear to understand through his thick accent. Prof is a bit annoying as he name drops a lot. Not a very good presenter at all, not easily approachable and does not engage the students well. Class materials are taken off randomly from the internet. Avoid if you can if there are better choices, Professor Ezzat is a awesome teacher. He has many years of experience in the job industry. I really recommend him. The best professor in the computer science department., Good teacher, reasonable slides and good explanations. Makes the subject very easy to understand and enjoyed taking the class with Professor Ezzat, Has credible industry experience which you should take advantage of, always answers questions. I see a lot of people complaining about his style, but Im thankful I took this class with him., No real coding, some pseudo-code and a lot of theory. If you want to learn more and do hands-on coding, dont take him.  If you want to make sure you pass this class and dont care about learning hands-on, take him. Also, he often answers more questions during tests than he should., This prof is really bad. Once he shouted at a student in our class. He is the most arrogant man I have ever seen. He goes over slides quickly, does not answer questions by just brushing them off. No programming assignments. Wont explain the concepts well. Not recommended., Its Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms. The entire concept is going to be difficult no matter what. Professor isnt of much help with homework, but in lectures he does his best to help with any and all questions. Take advantage of his industry experience and ask questions that try to relate class concepts with the real world., From what I heard, Ezzat was brought to fill in classes that didnt have enough sections, which is shown in his effort. All lectures are run off of pre-made slides and sometimes doesnt know whats on them. No coding assignments, all theory Qs from the book. However, hes inspiring and shows experience in the industry. Great person, bad professor., I dont really write rating, but this guy is exceptionally bad. Bad habit:He is always right, name drop, go over slide in 10 mins, does not know his stuff. If you dont have any choice, then take him. Good luck! Btw, He is the same professor from Santa Clara University. You can see his rating over there for more detail."
Faramarz Mortezaie,/professor/2148983,3.5,68%,3,"Easy professor. He is lazy, so you can turn whatever you want in, and you will always get a full grade. He teaches at four community colleges and universities at the same time, so his quality of teaching is not really high., Prof Mortezai is one the best cs teacher ive had at SJSU. Take him, he is sarcastic and give good examples to learn OS. He is really good grader and wants you to pass., Exams were copy and paste of the practice exams and the online HW questions. If you are willing to cram and memorize them, you should easily get Bs on the midterms. The final is much harder and requires hand writing code. If you do good on the 1st two exams, project, and all the HW, you should be able to bomb the final and pass with a B., Honestly, I think Prof. Mortezaie is very chilled and lazy lol. But his lecture isnt too difficult. Also he provided a practice exam before the real exam, the real exam contents basically are the same as the practice exam. So I think getting an A is very easy in this class., I dont know why Prof Mortezaie doesnt have a higher score, he is funny and great at teaching. I took Prof Andreopouloss class, but it was too much homework so I dropped it. Prof Mortezaies class is rather exam-based (medium-level difficulty) with fewer assignments (easy-med level). He records all lectures so I only attended exam days, TAKE HIM, One of the Best Professors so Far No Mandatory Attendance. Exams are also based on exam reviews provided by him., Had prof for cmpe30 and is just as good for 126. Lectures are a bit slow but he breaks them down in a way that are easily understandable. Posts review questions/topics for exactly what will be on the exam and is a pretty lenient grader. Records all lectures and uploads onto canvas., He did a great job when explaining the abstract concepts of OS by using normal-life analogy to make sure everyone could understand. No cheatsheet in the exams, so it kinda makes the exams be harder than usual. Take this professor, study all the materials and complete all the homework, then you should be fine., Lectures are boring but decently informative with visuals & analogies to ease the learning curve. Exams have coding in C on paper & lean closer to difficult than medium. His study guides are quite vague. Group project was long & difficult. Grading strictness on HW and discussions depends on his TA. Hes caring & does give extensions when necessary., Chill class, he records lectures so you dont even have to go to class. But honestly, lots of topics can be found on YouTube, though youll still want to skim through the lectures. Light weekly HW, doable in 1 day. Although tests are medium-hard difficulty so youll want to study for that. He gives a study guide for those but theyre 100% accurate., Learning C, not too bad, lots of outside resources. Grading criteria for the homework was kinda confusing, taking off points for what feels like no reason. Class is pretty straight forward since its just coding. Reviewing old tests for the final is helpful., Nice prof just kinda low energy. He often just posts the answers to the current hw for some reason. I found reading the textbook to be easier than paying attention to his lectures. Didnt feel like I learned that much. Exams are medium-hard difficulty IMO, you will want to study for them., Prof Mortezie is great. His lectures may seem low energy at times but he does care about his students learning the material. For CMPE30, his class is pretty easy and beginner friendly. Make sure you read your book and stay on top of your homework/labs. Midterms and final are straightforward., Lectures in circles. Understanding/nice if you talk to him in class.\nDiscussion+hw almost every week, but falls behind schedule. Takes forever to grade assignments (other than midterms/final). Really bamboozled us with the final (misleading final review). \nUnderstand/self study the hw to do well, keep an updated cheat sheet for tests, 3.5 is way too low of a rating for Professor Mortezaie. This guy is probably among the nicest professors I have met at SJSU. As the other reviews say, sometimes it can seem like low energy, but he genuinely cares about his students. Hes also a really funny dude so that helps when he explains concepts, he mixes a bit of humor. Take him! Hes great., Professor Mortezaie is so supportive of all his students! He definitely appreciates class participation and is always willing to go line by line in his code explanations. I for sure recommend him to anyone who struggled with CS in the past. Took class for grade forgiveness AND omg did I understand Operating Systems and C soooo much better with him., Lectures the entire 50 minutes but his examples are helpful. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework, the midterms and final are easy. Also very flexible if you need to reschedule an exam or homework date., Regarding CMPE 30 specifically, most of the learning was done during the lab. Attendance wasnt required but still helpful for learning the concepts. Would definitely recommend attending the last few lectures though as some topics were covered there which werent taught in lab. Overall he was a good professor., Great lecturer, goes over content really well and uses analogies to make content digestible. The book is great too, use it to understand things better. Lectures were recorded. Be sure to actually do the homework to prep for the tests. You get a cheatsheet. My only gripe is I felt there was too many trick problems on the tests, so read carefully., I took Mortezaie for CMPE 102 and CMPE 126. Amazing professor, as long as you attend class and pay attention you can pass the class easily. His lectures can be all over the place (and can get a bit monotone) but he always ties it to the exams so listen up when he says something like it will be in our exam or something like that. cheers!, Lectures are rather confusing, and if you have him in the morning you might fall asleep. Grades veeeery slowly, and grading criteria isnt really clear. Also is unresponsive to emails. However, in class he does his best to answer students questions thoroughly and provide explanations. Overall a good guy, just needs improvement as a professor., Professor is one of the kindest teachers I have ever had. He cares about the students learning and grades. You simply have to do what he assigns and the class designed for you to Atleast pass. He is also available outside of class and very skilled in explaining concepts in a way that makes sense., Im taking CMPE102 of this professor. Everything is great until now. Just always come to the class, stay focused on his lecture, and prepare to do the assignments some days before due dates. If youre stuck on some parts of his lecture, feel free to write email or come ask him, he will reply to you very fast!, Dont take this guy. His lecture is one of the most boring pieces of garbage Ive ever had the displeasure of finding myself attending, and his tests dont coorelate in any respect with his lecture or his homework. Honestly, youre better off postponing taking this class if hes your only option. DONT TAKE THIS GUY!, Took him during the summer, Good professor, answers questions clearly with good examples like when he explains deadlocks and hes not rude about it like profs can be sometimes. Two exams where each are 30 percent of your grade so not a fan of that. Doesnt grade with participation but keeps it in mind when students are near the grade threshold., He is one of the best professors Ive had in the department. He knows how to explain topics and is open to questions. He curves exams if necessary. HW is reasonable and doable. He goes over exams and HW. He can be lazy at times and may not seem ready to teach, however, mostly he is a decent professor., Doesnt show up prepared for lectures and spends time looking for code to use as examples instead of explaining the concepts to us. Did not post the final on the scheduled date; an exam that was meant to be proctored via lockdown browser and video monitoring. Lectures are unorganized and boring -- take this professor only if you must., He is one of the best professors in the department. He lectures pretty well and posts extra videos/notes to help students learn. He is flexible with due dates if you ask him. Overall, fairly chill professor., Most of the learning is done in labs. There are a lot of HW assignments, 2 exams which were decent, and the final was a bit hard. But, Prof. Mortezaie is a good professor and his lectures help. He is very flexible with his students, he gave us either in person or online class attendance option which made it very convenient., stay away. i have almost a perfect gpa, studied hours especially during the weekends of exams, and went to every lecture. i still got a B, not even a B+. he doesnt respond to emails either :), Weekly homework and short quizzes on canvas. For the HW, some are easy, some take a bit more time, but nothing crazy difficult. Try to pay attention to lectures and refer to the textbook for the HWs and you should be able to get an A or B easily. Grading was a little slow. There was supposed to be a project but it didnt happen for us., He cured my sleeping disorder. His lecture is the worlds best lullaby. I open his lecture recordings at night to sleep. Take him if you have a sleeping problem! Best therapy ever!, Discussion every week, pop quiz which is freakin proctored (who does that?!) 2 Midterms, Final. Its impossible to cheat in his class because no one knows the answers. Bring a pillow to class so that your head dont crash on the desk when you pass out. And bring a pillow for your pillow coz your pillow will fall asleep too. Finalword DONT TAKE HIM, DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR, I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. His lecture is so boring that you wont even care to attend class. He doesnt care to explain anything when you ask him. His tests are super heavy and hard and it doesnt relate to the lecture at all. He wont give any curve or extra credit. MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE COVID-19 VIRUS, This class is way too hard. He doesnt give any further explanations when you ask questions., Solid teacher. Not amazing, not bad. Will teach you things and it will make sense. Homework is not easy but not hard as long as youre following the class. Cares about students and is lenient. Would recommend him if none of the other teachers are amazing., He explains really well and doesnt grade very harshly, take him!, Ive had professor Mortezaie for both cmpe30 and cmpe102. He is considerate and caring towards the students. Learning from cmpe30 is mostly done in labs, but the lectures do really help. In cmpe102 there are weekly quizzes which he pretty much goes over before you take. Homework is really not that heavy and they help you learn material., His lectures and quizes to not match. His lectures consist of him writing code and occasionally showing your his hand written notes that only make sense for him. You must go out of your way and review quizlets from other students and a few things that the professor highlights. Quizes and exams really effect your grade., Certainly the worst class Ive ever taken in my college career. 3 exams 75% and 25% for quiz and. He is really disorganized, not ready to teach all the time and test are really challenging. No extra credit, no curves, no office hours, nothing. Doesnt respond to emails either. Self study class with someone who doesnt care at all. God bless you., Really doesnt care about his students. Hw and exams had no relation to each other whatsoever. Learned nothing at all. Most of what we did was never explained how we would use it in real life. Self-learned absolutely everything. Never responded to emails. Didnt have office hours either. Exams were impossible., Honestly, I had to self-learn everything in this class. The only material he provided that I learned through was the homework. The midterms and final are a big % too. 1 project at the end of the semester that he did not even prepare us for. I felt like I learned nothing from him. The lectures are too lecture heavy and his notes are a total mess., Really learn the material while he is lecturing it. Make sure to understand and visualize each concept given on each data structure or algorithm. Take notes on laptop and make visualizations on what he is lecturing and make a study guide of each concept. Be prepared for coding questions on the test that can be related to any concept you learned., Took him in summer. Always answers your questions. There were about 4 homework and about 10 labs. They were easy if you put some effort. There was a final group project with the SJOne board. He values your effort and gives grade according to that. Would take him again for CmpE 102., The professor has no desire to teach. Goes over little things in whats supposed to be a huge lesson in a matter of 15 minutes. Awkward silences for 10. Then tells us to write a program he makes up on the spot. Doesnt give us guidelines on how to tackle it, no feedback on hw or tests. No enthusiasm. Im surviving but, I hate this class. Dont take., His 8AM CMPE30 class is alright. He knows his material but has a hard time getting it across to his students. Mainly learned everything from working on projects in the lab and self-learning. Hes a good teacher but his lectures could be better., Based on personal experience with his 8 AM CMPE 30 class, Id say attendance isnt important until near the end of the semester, majority of learning came from labs. Posts study guides online although they are a bit messy, they are pretty accurate to the midterms. Seldom gives homework, they can be a bit challenging but are graded leniently., This is one of those classes were almost all of the learning is from the lab. As long as if you do all the lab work and make sure you understand it, you should pass this class. There are some things on the final that isnt taught in the lab, so you should show up to the last few lectures at the end of the semester. Online notes are really bad., boring professor and unprepared for Lectures. Had him in the AM, he would write down what he is saying during the lecture on an IPad and would frequently read off his own notes or the book. Takes pictures of the book during the lecture for his slides. Needs prepared slides/info and didnt cover everything needed in class, now unprepared for CS158B, Professor Mortezaie is a great professor. His homework was moderately difficult but definitely manageable. Hes a professor that really cares about his student passing his class.  He made Data Structure pretty easy to comprehend. Also the group projects were fun to do. But I suggest you start on those early! Highly recommended."
Johnny Martin,/professor/886674,2.1,N/A,3.7,"I am glad he is not teaching anymore, what a horrible teacher. He was all over the place and at the end of the class he would scribble on the board and that was his lecture. He would spend most of the class hour talking about his personal issues, and things he did not like about the department., RIP Johnny Martin, The class has no text book.  The only guidance you get for preparing for a test is do the home work.  Which actually only helps a little.  Homework is only worth 4% of your grade yet it is a lot of work.  If you take this get ready for chaos., AVOID! He misgrades most of the midterms. If youre forced to take him, make sure you check his answer keys he posts online. But good luck getting pts back because he never responds to email., He says will test you on your knowledge of a given programming language but rather he will test you on tricks.  Impossible to study for tests as there is no real course material to study from.  Half of the lecture is personal stories, as interesting as they are, they are totally useless in retrospect to how the class is doing., He doesnt teach, talks poorly about his colleagues during lectures, never goes to office hrs, never answers emails, forgets to upload HW, errors in quiz questions, quizzes dont test knowledge but useless details about subject material. DO NOT TAKE., Expects you to know subtle differences on the exams (tricky questions), but doesnt even lecture about it. Instead, he expects you to program on your free time to find subtle differences., Nice guy, but not a good teacher.  Ask only trick question on the tests.  Which are multiple choice.  Makes three of the four possible answer very close to right to trick you into picking them.  Insane homeworks that are only worth 4% of your total grade., Bad professor in SJSU I wish he would retire soon., Avoid taking a class with this professor at all costs (if possible). For my major he was the only choice for three classes that I could take and I must say by far this is the worst professor Ive ever taken. His code is all buggy (including in his notes) and he debugs in class time more than lectures. Very slow on just about everything. Irrational., pros: he appears passionate, funny, tells you nice stories, class atmosphere is nice, homeworks are challenging in a good way, only way to learn in  his class cons: unorganized, only teaches average 20 minutes out of 1:15 minutes class, the other section with another teacher covered so many topics, we only covered a fraction of what they covered, He is a cool professor; he codes in class. He only spends ten percent of the time lecturing, and the rest he will tell you his stories. During offices hours, he is not available. Not recommended if you want to learn assembly language., Worst professor in CS department. He doesnt teach at all, have fun googling for hours.He is easy to get angry If you have questions.Homeworks are hard, no Hw solution.I would not recommend you guy take his class., Bad professor in SJSU, He doesnt teach anything.I would not recommnend you guy take his class, The spaciest dude I have ever met. Cant stay on topic to save his life. He is however, passionate and understands the subject thoroughly, but this doesnt come across well in the course. Grades were updated 3 times in an entire semester. I wouldnt recommend., Interesting character to say the least. Prone to spending the majority of class talking about unrelated material. Will usually blow you off if you ask him for help. Notes are full of errors. He rarely updates the grades. However, he is at least very enthusiastic about the material. Nice guy overall but consider other options if available..., In this class he doesnt use a book, he just expects you to program a lot. His tests are multiple choice with a few programming problems. What most people dont like about him is on his tests there are some questions where knowing the answer does not depend on your attending lecture as much as if you programmed out of class. I loved his class tho., PROS: very current, knowledgable, industry experience, curves grades, explains relevancy of material, lecturing style encourages student participation, emphasizes material that will help your career CONS: doesnt use texts; errors in demos/lectures/exams/notes/assignments; updates notes/assignments w/out notice; no solutions to assignments, His exams are difficult. I am getting a B though. I noticed this professor plays favorites. He always let his favorite student get away with disturbing him and is less harsh on them in class., The class is disjointed. Exam questions are irrelevant to HW. Notes are too brief, have fun Googling for hours. Does not provide feedback. Takes too long to return back exams, hw, and quizes. His TA grades the HW, so you will never get to shine because he doesn\t personally grade your code and seems to not care. No solutions for HW either., One of the best instructors at SJSU. Johnny is up to date with new technologies (unlike most of the faculty) and knows how the industry works. Great class if you already know some basic html/css/js. Study smart and have an interest for web development and you will learn what is needed to land a job at an internet company., worst professor of CS department. doesnt teach at all. just talks about his gf and france. expects you to do everything on your own. let us to read specifications and do huge vague project labs. take some one elses class, worst professor of all times. no feedback on assignments, horrible lectures, expects a lot of reading and coding, doesnt teach at all, dont curve and dont expect his help in doing assignments or hws. take Pollets class - same course contents., doesnt teach at all.no notes, no books, no feedback, no curve even if whole class going bad.expects a lot and makes you to read specifications which are useless and vague.doesnt teach any coding and still expects you to write complex coding in exams.worst professor, took no interest in checking assignments or helping students.never take his class, Hes very disorganized. He has stopped posting notes, and he just talks nonsense during class. He tests on code, but doesnt teach code, and his HW has vague descriptions. His expectations are way to high, infact its vague..., Horrible Professor.Students have to do everything on their own.Doesnt teach at all.Expects alot and huge assignments from students without teaching a single code.Dont ever take his class.Throw up everything like a fire hose.Finished HTML,XML,CSS,Javascript,jQuery,PHP,DOM,PostGres,XSLT,XPath in one month ie. 8 classes, Dont ever take his class. Always talks about his personal life and French culture.Useless lectures.HWs are huge and really hard.Make you to read specifications and manuals.Will not teach anything about programming and coding.Will ruin your interest in web development., Do attend the class. You will learn a lot from his lecture. He doesnt use the book much often, but hes lecture is crystal clear. He does has a lot of real world experience. Very helpful if you can chat with him after class, Johnny is great professor.He creates a great interest in learning the programming.He helps to understand the concept thoroughly.Tests are multiple choice questions with one or two program.If someone wants to learn java basics then attend this class., I couldnt imagine a better CS46A professor. I thank Johnny this professor for single handedly teaching me and 15 other students Java.  Martin lectures really well and shows you step by step examples of what he is talking about. He teaches you what you need to know to program in Java. You MUST take this professor., You will learn A LOT. Challenging, even for student with real-world experienced. But that what makes this class great, you are forced to THINK, not just do, but you have to do A LOT of coding on wide verity of languages, some you might never seen before., This is a very KEWL MAN. He wants to let everyone pass the class. But make sure study hard! His exams are tough even though they are just multiple choice questions. Make some buddies for homework assignments \cause you might not do by yourself. Martin is a smart guy and he works for Paypal...:) Go with his class now! I am trying to advertise him., No Comments, Very smart guy; tends to wing his classes as hes confident. Presents some very difficult programming problems and isnt afraid to require some serious knowledge from the students. Tests are multiple choice though, so even that theyre very detail focused theyre not that bad., Martin is the easiest prof for cs152. His exams and final are all Scantron multiple choice and are ridiculously easy. Programming assignments can be challenging, but he lets you work in groups so you can find someone smart to do all the work and just study for the exams. A really cool guy and makes lectures entertaining. He only teaches part time."
Navrati Saxena,/professor/2626481,4.2,85%,3.1,"Dr. Saxena is caring, kind, and easy to approach. I enjoyed her class as she understood that we had other upper-level STEM courses and she focused more on the theories than coding, which will be important once AI knows how to code. Also, Kalindi, the Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader, was amazing. Attending the SI sessions helped immensely., Kind and caring professor, lectures are engaging and she doesnt dwell on less important points. Always makes it clear why you learn each topic, and relates things back to succeeding in job interviews and the workforce. Enjoyed the class a lot, but be prepared as the exams make up a large part of the grade and you need to remember everything., Her slides are very good, and she cares about the material and if students fully understand or not what she demonstrates on the white board. Class has 5 homework assignments, and if you go by her slides and homework, her two quizzes, midterm, and final shouldnt be so bad, Professor Saxena was great. She taught the concepts very clearly and mostly focused on the concepts of DSA and not the coding applications. The tests were multiple choice/fill-in-the-blank but each point counts for 1% of your grade so it is easy to lose points unexpectedly. Some of her test questions were slightly unfair but SI made up for it., Professor Saxena is very kind. She is always willing to work with you to the best of her ability. Very approachable and has great lectures. Her slides are made really well and the concepts are properly explained. She also ensures she is at pace with the students and doesnt rush lectures. Class is more conceptual and she gives work field advice., The other reviews imply that shes fallen off but that couldnt be farther from the truth. She is genuinely one of the nicest professors I have ever taken. She does a good job explaining things, and if you are confused she will take time to go over it again to make sure you understand. Class is focused more on theory and you dont code too much., Im not sure whats up with all these ratings but Professor Saxena has been so kind. She is willing to do so much for her students like pausing during class for the information to process and letting students take pictures of the board. The tests make up most of your grade, but her tests are not that bad and she provides practice problems., She can be direct in class, which can be tough for students with social anxiety. Her grading lacks partial credit, making it challenging for those close to passing. She also covers material quickly, likely due to time constraints.\nI have understood the rules and I am following the guidelines. She was very moody and got pissed off most of time., Saxena was an easy professor when she was new to SJSU faculty. But over the years and semesters her reputation of multiple choice exams went down the drain. The class is next to impossible to get an A, You can pass for sure, but getting an A is difficult and this mostly just due to careless mistakes on exams. Exams are now fill in blank, no MC, I would avoid this professor. She is knowledgeable but extremely rude and condescending at times. Also she has  tendency to over plie and cram a lot of information like slides on students while the overall class is behind schedule according to syllabus. She made class more stressful than it already is. AVOID. Does not curve. Took her for CS158A., + Proessor Navratis teaching style is amazing. \n+ Easy homeworks; can also be submitted 3 time for a better grade. \n- The tests are difficult and are a major percentage of your grade.\n- 1 point in the class is equivalent to 1%. If you get 12/25 on the midterm, you lose about 13% of your final grade.\n- No curve.\n+ Professor is always available., Shes an OK professor and lecturer. She regularly goes off script and then says things that are wrong and when you ask questions she ignores you and tells you shes right. Does a lot of little things that are just her way of doing it. If you want to pass DSA shes a good choice, low homework. But her test questions are confusing and shes just ok., Her lectures were always super helpful and informative. Theres not too many hw assignments, mostly quizzes and the midterms. My only real complaint is that when I took her class she did not give any partial credit on exams, which lost me a lot of points., Her teaching is just an average quality. There are a few homeworks and exams are multiple choice based. She doesnt post any grade stats and usually releases grades pretty late. There are pros and cons to have multiple choice exams using Scantron (no partial credits) but its ok to get this difficult course done with less stress., Shes average. Lectures are alright, but generally just doesnt cover enough examples nor gives enough practice. BUT exam problems for the most part were pretty much similar to the examples she did go over. Each test/quiz problem is 1%, some 2% or 3% of your overall grade. No partial credit. HW is free tho., She is an amazing professor. Her grading was fairly genuine and neat. Her teaching is what matters the most, take it you will learn a lot from this class. Will recommend taking her class again., The best SJSU professor, really cares for her students. Explains the concepts really well, gives enough HW and keeps motivating you to do better. For a good grade, suggest to attend all the classes and follow in class instructions. Even allows resubmissions on HW. In all, the focus is on learning and not just grades. Will Highly recommend her., Lectures were great with clear, guided examples for each algorithm. Her quizzes were not too difficult if you just did the practice questions. Homework sometimes LeetCode questions and you could resubmit again until you got 100%., Awesome Professor, really cares for the students and takes effort to solve any doubt you may have. Took it in summer and so it looked like there would be less time to learn but she did an awesome job in explaining all the concepts. There are no regrades but she does give extensions and if you just follow through her lectures, you will surely excel, Idk what happen but her summer class Grades looks chaos. She explained lecture good, but her grading is very hard. No partial,extra credits or curve. A lot of us got destroyed with such a harsh grading and tough exam questions. She was good in online but very very hard in in person class. Would be nice if she atleast curve. If no alot of usll fail., Cares greatly about her students. For homework theres no hard deadline so you can turn them in late to a certain degree for full credit and resubmit until you get it right. No partial credit on exams/quizzes, quizzes for each module, midterm on first half of modules, final isnt cumulative (only second half of modules)., This Professor can really teach! Ive learned so much stuff in this class. HW was fairly easy. The quizzes on the other hand were difficult and this is also due to the fact that every points is worth 1 percent of your total overall grade. Shes becoming more challenging as she teaches in-person now., Unlimited revisions on homework, easy lectures. As long as you show up you will get an A., Her #1 priority in the class is making her slides/explanations as SIMPLE as possible. She will go over the concepts many time so that nobody is confused. The environment in her class makes it very easy for the students to succeed/get good grades., Professor Saxena is amazing and by far one of my favorite professors at SJSU. She makes it her goal that students understand the material thoroughly by slowly introducing new concepts and explaining them in an easy-to-understand way. If you are ever confused, dont be afraid to ask. She will always go out of her way to help you until you get it., Professor Saxena is easily the most understanding professor I have ever had. Not only is she kind but she is very good at teaching the material. There is quite a bit to learn in the class but she makes it as easy as possible while also giving all the information. If you have a choice for CS 146 choose her., Shes a great professor and very caring, probably the best 146 prof., Professor Saxena is one of the best professors in the CS department. Lecture is very easy, and always open to feedback for her lectures. One midterm and final with a few homework and quizzes that are very manageable. She also invited guest lecturers at the end of the semesters to tell us the importance of algorithms. Wont regret taking her., Professor Saxena is legit the nicest professor. This was her first-semester teaching but she explained each topic clearly and slowly. It is easy to understand and if you dont you always have youtube. She has a couple of quizzes over lockdownbrowser and homework (no coding req) but its pretty easy as long as you study for it., Professor Saxena is the best CS teacher a student could ask for. Her lectures are very clear, you can tell she really cares, and shes available outside class. When I came to her for help, she gave me the encouragement to keep going and offered what help she could give. If you have the chance to, enroll with Professor Saxena., Absolutely amazing professor. She genuinely cares about her students doing well and gives so many opportunities for her to help you. I just dont like her grading system. About 90% of your grade is based on quizzes and exams, which can make it a little scary but dont worry, her class is def easy if you pay attention!, I am currently taking her class, and she is one of the best professors Ive had in CS classes! She really cares her students, always offering for help, and she encourages students to ask questions in her lecture. Her tests are very reasonable. If you do homework and study, it should be fine. I am always excited to attend her lectures!"
Sin-Min Lee,/professor/226533,2.2,N/A,2.6,"He doesnt teach but if you like sjsu students to give amateur lectures for each class, then this is a class for you.  But be warned, more than half of the students there dont speak fluent english neither. so pick your poison., This guy is crazy, and I mean CRAZY. Impossible to understand lectures, just a horrible teacher if he can even be called that.  He simply just doesn\t know how to teach, everything you learn will be from YOU learning it, not from him. I wish the best of luck to anyone taking a class with him, I got a B and I really am not sure how., Boring lectures. He doesnt explain the concept very clearly, but expects students know it all. Good thing: he gives many extra credits ,and you dont want to miss these chances. Quiz every other day, but I like it because it makes me read and learn the lecture slides. Final is optional if you earn good grade on midterms. No textbook is required., Most of the reviews reflect how this prof teach.  I took RDBMS with him in the 80s and  did not learn anything.  I have to re-learn the database on my own.  I think it will do justice to the students if he just retire and let new faces do the teaching. Just my $0.02 cents, Lee is not as easy as he looks. He gives a quiz every other day. Midterms were not to difficult, as half the questions are multiple choice. However, he only gave one hw (which was hard) and made it worth 15% of the entire course grade, which ended up screwing over a lot of ppl. His final was super hard. The book is useless, just study his slides., If planning to take this track CS 157A&B and u want good grades then go with Lee for both the classes. Covers what is needed but his teaching style is not that great. Reads from ppt slides and makes students understand the concepts by repeating the same thing again and again. Conclusion: If you want good grade then Lee is the guy., If youre a self-starter, youll learn a lot from the lecture slides and do well for this class. The class web page which covers essential course materials is very helpful for me. He does explain important algorithms in class and make sure students understand and very helpful during office hours as well., DONT DO IT! U wont learn anything. He cant teach... he was supposed to retire but I dont know wtf hes still doing here. Hes like 80% blind... 1/2 the time he talks about irrelevant stuff. You have to learn on your own... total waste of an education.. no wonder people say SJSU CS dept sucks, when you have professors like him, pretty laid back class. expects you to learn by your own. regular quizzes keeps your aware. dont really care who grades the tests, as long as you do it correctly, you earn the points. dont have to buy the book if you are not afraid of missing any require knowlegdes cover from CHs but not in class. 3 easy midterms,1 presentation+group project+exam., No Comments, The worst prof at SJSU. Does not arrive prepd to lecture. Gives excuses of eye prob. ARBITRARY grading on quizzes/exams by STUDENTS (no grader) spent 10 HOURS on VAGUE assignment (NO details EVER given) just to have UNMOTIVATED STUDENT grade it. hOrRiBle lecture, then quizzes u RIGHT after! Just Lazy! PLEASE Stay away!!! From an A+ 157A student!!!, An OK class,the professor makes one learn by having regular quizzes in the class and mainly by practicing.Quizzes are real tough but account for only 10% of the grade.HWs and presentation are quite straight forward.Gives extra credit so one can recover.Went over fast for topics like SQL,Relational calculus but normalization was covered well., nice guy, but unclear and unorganize. you have to depend on and learn the material by yourself outside class. you need to prepare for pop quizzes (10%) that is given out almost every class and 3 midterms (30%)through out the semester. Hard to get good grades., Good Heart! And Easy to get a good grade!, hes unclear but hes a nice person. Lots of extra credit opportunity. :), This guy is just crazy. He teaches us a buncha stuff then tests us on something totally different. The book is totally useless. Sometimes he tells us stories out of the blue that go off on some wild tangent. His grading system is just insane(partial credit on multiple choice?)The only way i passed was to do load of extra credit. Avoid at all costs., agreeably difficult teacher, lectures are often unclear, book is NOT required, programs are easy if you are a decent programmer. the key to the class is to read the lecture slides yourself and to do lots of extra credit. very good willed teacher, but sometimes a pain. final is optional in some cases, WORST teacher ever, claimed to have Parkinsons. Midterms, lectures, and quizes are all irrelevant. Lecture notes and programming assignment  s are taken from other univs. Plagiarism. Do not buy the textbook as it will never be used in class., Good Heart!  And Easy to get a good grade!, tough tough professor, doesnt teach very well....but allows extra credit for screw ups.... midterms are not relevant to lectures... dont recommend, Prof. with a good heart.  EXTREMELY unorganized.  Not a good teacher to learn from, tends to be confusing. very approachable outside of class.  Plenty of quizes to keep you aware., Very helpful and approachable outside of class, programs are a bit challenging but you can resubmit for a better grade, student presentations helped enhence class concepts., true: unorganize, not clear on lecture, lots of program. What you dont know: he curves, if you do some extra credit easy stuff(like grading, simply research) ull pass. deep down nice guy wants to stuff as much stuff into students as possible. easy class, doesnt like to teach anything.  most of the time you are learning from your classmates.  Grades you as if he is teaching your lots of stuff.  When he does decide to teach, its usually hard to follow. Tells too many unuseful stories., No Comments, Learn nothing, Very confusing teacher. Expect to learn everything on your own. Plagorizes other notes for his lectures then tells stupid stories. Past his time, he should retire., HORRIBLE. No one in the class could follow his lectures, which often do not correspond to the many quizes we had. HE SHOWED NO CONCERN to the students. He just wanted us to help him with his research for extra credit, which however did not help the grades, He is ok.  Some of his program assignments were based on his own personal variation of class topics.  Unfortunately his English is not so good and it can be a pain to understand sometimes.  I thought he was friendly and he made funny jokes., I you want to work after graduation, never register his classes., If you speak Chinese, hell be much softer on you once you speak in Chinese. The book is good; so if you read it, you can learn a lot. Tests and quizzes are randome material so the better you are a logic, the better your chances."
Soon Tee Teoh,/professor/630528,4.2,88%,3.1,"Probably one of the best options for 147. Its a tough class no matter what, but he explains the concepts very well. Homework and practice exams prepare you for the exams and everything felt fair, plus it was open notes so no need to memorize little details. Only downside is the harsh grading scale (you need a 96 for an A and a 92 for an A-)., Great teaching style, cares about subject, very interesting to watch, explains things in an understandable and clear way, knowledgeable, reasonable homework assignments and tests. Highly appreciated industry knowledge he gave. One thing is that his lecture slides dont have all the information you need, Teoh is amazing at teaching CS 147. 147 can be a difficult subject, but Teoh is extremely capable of explaining every concept in a digestible manner. His slides are very concise and provide a very clear summary of the lectures. Tests are open notes, like the homework but with a curveball question. 100% recommended. A is a 96% min, strict grading., The course is well designed and lectured. I have had a better understanding about the whole picture of computer Architecture after taking this course. He explains concepts logically and clearly. Would take his course again, The professor was great, however tests were hard. Homeworks were long. 96% for an A. Solid option for challenger!, Slides are not the nicest, but is pretty good at explaining. Caring and tries to answer as many questions as possible and to be thorough when going over HW and tests. Extended several due dates with no penalty and, though class def got harder after EZ 1st test, seems that he was less harsh grading final. HW can be easily aced. Need > 96% for an A., Solid choice. Explains concepts generally well. HW is doable and not time-consuming, but having a class Discord gc helps a lot. Exams are similar to HW and study guides but with a few changes. I felt it got progressively harder after the 1st exam, and HW and exams reflected this. Tough grading scale (A- is 95.99) so you have little room for error., Very good professor. Take his class!, The class itself is useless in learning game programming. Teoh almost entirely focuses on uselessly specific 3d constructs skipping over 2d. No actual programming taught. You can get 100% on all of your home programming projects, but still get a low grade because of the incongruous exams asking painfully specific 3D math. Take Linear Algebra first!, Fairly tough class and Teoh does the best he can to teach it primarily to CS majors who are not as used to dealing with the hardware side. Interesting material but I felt Teoh went way too fast in lecture, making it almost impossible to keep up with everything hes covering. Tests and hw were straight from lecture material. Dont miss lectures!, Excellent prof, and kindhearted guy. Knows his graphics programming and speaks with authority on advanced topics in graphics programming. He requires you to demo your code to him to make sure you understand it but this is actually very beneficial. Its a chance to receive feedback on how to improve it. Not many professors care enough to do that., Very clear, inspiring and challenging presentation of material. Total of two midterms and a final exam. 5 homework assignments, none of which are programming assignments. On the other hand, he likes to end lectures early, 30 to 15 min. This time could be spent more productively. Otherwise, very positive experience. Recommended., One of the best young professors at SJSU. Hes always prepared, very methodical. I also take 116A. Got As in both classes. He made them easy and enjoyable., Dr. Teoh is a great Professor. The course is rather hard, but his lectures is very clear and helpful. Quizzes, midterms, and final are totally coverred by lectures and study guides. Take his class!, The subject is tough, but Teoh makes it easier to understand.  He is very accommodating to all of the students.  Exams are straight from the lecture notes, but that doesnt help much since the subject is so difficult.  Go to every class.  You dont want to miss anything since it may show up on the exam and only covered on that one day., Very good teacher.  Clear lectures.  Answers questions well.  Fun homework assignments.  Easy to learn and I learned a lot in his class.  Midterms and final are not easy, but they are very straight-forward.  Just study a bit and you will be fine.  I recommend taking any of his classes., Awesome teacher! He is there for you to learn. He is very thorough with his slides and his examples. Hell even wait for you write down what is on the board before continuing. His midterms and final are fair because this is a somewhat medium/hard subject. Always attend! Youll never know what youll miss......, Really nice guy.  Lectures are easy to understand given you have a good understanding of math(you should this is CS).  Projects are helpful.  Good teacher considering the material he teaches is fairly difficult at times., Lectures are organize and clear.  Homework and Exams are not so bad.  I would take any of the class he is teaching., I like this instuctor because he is so clear about what he expects from students.  He is very organized and professional and he sets you up to succeed., A great professor!  Clear, concise, and organized.  His midterms draw heavily on the review sheets he gives you, so no real surprises, especially if you pay attention in class.  Pay attention, do the homework, study the review sheet, and youll be fine., Very organized and straight-forward teacher. There are no surprises, no curve balls. He clearly presents what you need to know without nonsense. Young and yet one of the few proper teachers of the generally mediocre SJSU CS staff., Good teacher. Very clear and straightforward in explaining everything. Your grade in his 147 is dependent on how much work you put into it - so study a lot, especially for his tests., You learn as much as you want to in Teohs class.  His lectures are succinct and to the point, and hes a friendly dude.  While the bare minimum requirements for any project are pretty easy to meet, it takes an often substantial amount of time to invest to get all the bonus points.  Tests can be rough, but arent bad if you go over lecture notes., Sure, I beleive he is very considerate, and thats why 69.5 and you will get a D+. His tests are freaking hard. Doesnt know how to make a exam question. He made the final too long and thats why gave 20% boost up in one sec and another sec 10%. No matter how much he knows about the subject, he needs to know how to make ques.., Has good command of English language, unlike a few profs in the CS department.  The lectures are very clear and organized, and his online notes are very helpful too.  Some assignments and exams are tough, but hes quite reasonable in his expectations. Returns graded tests and homework promptly., He *does* throw a lot of info at you, but lectures are online and contain excellent images/code (look them up yourself!). The painfulness of the project comes mostly from debugging the awkward glut code. Tests are difficult, but more math vs memorization - and he offers decent EC to curve. Books useless for coding hw - youre better off googling., Very clear, understandable, honest and fair professor. Its obvious he really understands the material, and hes good at conveying it. His lectures are usually also easy to sit through, he talks like a normal person and can be pretty funny., This guy surely knows a lot, except how to teach.  He just throws the ball to you and how to deal with it is your business.  Two easy homeworks followed by a 3D project that has nothing to do with previous hws make you lost in that matrix world. If you do want to this this class, be very good at math and read the text throughly(not a good book), Dont take his class. Projects are very hard. Exams are sucks. Book is also very bad. Give questions which you will have no idea from where to study. He does not care how students are doing in the class., What a great professor!  He is very funny and understanding.  He definitely helped me learn the subject material!  Great Teacher! Highly Recommended!"
Teng Moh,/professor/660443,2.3,13%,3.7,"The rudest professor at SJSU. Does not care about the students; does not respond to emails. Unethical and unprofessional behaviors. Unfortunately, he has a monopoly for CS 190 class., Very rude towards student. Dont help you in understanding concepts. Dont take his class., Dropped 247 on the first day\n\nFacts: \n1. Doesn\t have canvas, the website was down\n2. He says People nowadays get offended so easily\n3. He mentioned Master and Salve when talking something about the master\s program\n4. He uses childbirth as an analogy for the prerequisite. It goes like one woman 10 months but no 10 women 1 month, (CS274)Never take this professor!! Hes not a good teacher, does not care about students success. Even if you go to his office hours, he will derail from what you asked, he never gives a proper answer to your question. For the project, he gives limited set of research papers to choose and you need to replicate the project shown in research paper., Beware!! Extremely moody!! No feedback at all. Expects us to conduct research and publish new algorithms in a span of 1 month., When Tengo Moh was born his parents reaction must have been what a disappointment. This professor finds great pleasure in creating an hostile environment for students and deliberately makes learning difficult by his unclear teaching skills. Avoid at all costs. Professor should be fired cannot teach even if his own life was on the line. Disgraceful., A moody teacher, spends lots of time talking about proposals in class instead of giving them back with actual grades and comments. Like even the positive reviews mentions course goals and grading are very ambiguous. we dont know our grades throughout the semester. I was also warned by a couple of friends not to take his course., Never grade and give homework back. In the whole semester, you will only know your midterm score. I was warned by my friends that he give score unfair before take his class, and it turns out to be true., Funny guy. Super-friendly, super-patient. He is really there for the students, especially the students who love CS. The quality of his instruction is proportional to how engaged you are as a student, hes probably the most student-responsive prof Ive had. You need to be self-motivated, as goals and grading are very ambiguous. Good guy+professor., If youre self-motivated, youll learn a lot and do well. Ive taken many courses with Dr. Moh, most notably, machine learning and distributed computing; hes knowledgeable and passionate in these areas. If youre struggle, come see him during office hours; hes very understanding. He is honest and sincere about helping his students succeed., DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS if you really want to learn something! He cannot give explanation for the grade that he gives - doesnt even grade all your work so there is no feedback. He SLEEPS when the students give presentations. He randomly gives grades, and there are no published stats to figure out where you stand., I personally prefer Dr. Mohs teaching style, practical teaching materials and textbooks selections, and encouraging lectures. Students must study the materials and do hands-on course-work...and that is good. I took more than two classes from Dr. Moh and got all As. Thanks to Dr. Moh and those who teach evening classes., You basically have to learn everything on your own. All he does is try to explain whats printed in the book exactly as the book does. Cant ask questions because he makes things more confusing. Unclear expectations, but he tries to make up for it my manipulating grades. Haha for the last post, I did catch him sleeping through my presentation., He is very moody. Sleeps through the project presentations, so God knows how he grades the projects., A nice guy but a terrible teacher. Doesnt grade or return homework. Doesnt seem interested in the subject. Tons of reading, little guidance about whats important., Overall, the course was quite useful. We used the Stanford book DB Systems: The complete book and covered chap11-17. Last 2 weeks were for student presentations of their term projects. Exams tested you on whether you understood the concepts, so you can\t just memorize the material. The work load was avg for a grad-level CS class., This teacher demands that you learn by reading over 400 pages for each midterm on your own.Good luck passing this class, cause thats the only way you will[no matter how hard you work].He has quizes on subjects that you have not even learned yet,and you do not know what you receive on those quizes until you receive your grade.Its his way or  no way., Moh isnt so bad.  He can be funny, and his last segment (parallel processing) is where he shines.  He usually teaches straight out of the book.  Tests are killer = timed programming midterms.  Make sure your laptops primed with old code unless you think you can finish a program in 90 minutes from scratch...  And do the extra credit (+5% to grade), Not that bad at all. His test was hard. I scored above 80... not sure its luck or what but I tried to study very hard on the textbook and his note. By the way, hes very helpful during his office time. Ive been buging him every time and understood more about the materia being covered. Highly recommended for selflearners., Look at his class this way: quizzes are ahead of whats being covered. No ****ion for homework whatsoever. No study guide for test which forced you to study 2-3 chapters 200-300 pages long. Tests focused on questions with no right or wrong answer (and right answer would have to match his answers). GG sucker, He knows nothing to teach. He doesnt know how to teach. He cant explain things. He doesnt know how to grade stuff. Sloppy, lazy, loudsy., Very goofy, very funny, and very nice. Lenient grader. Not very clear in explaining the material, and the book was just bad, to my taste. Consult some other books, websites. And, take time to clearly understand each pattern. Class is very do-able, if you put in enough effort. But of course, some people take 4 or 5 classes at the same time. Spread!, He is a tough teacher because cs 151 is tough class. Easy going and helpful , should know java before even thinking about taking this class., Like he said, he really didnt want to teach this class, but was assigned anyway.  And it showed., Hard class, he may give you the impression hell be a hard professor in the beginning, but youll see he turns out to be a pretty lenient grader.  And hes actually pretty nice when you talk to him, be ready to put some effort in his class. He shows interest in helping students..and hates microsoft (if that in anyway, helps anyone..), very hard class... but this guys a good teacher. theres alotta freedom with the assignments.  the class isnt that bad though... u get what u put in it.  those who struggle simply dont try in his class.  the lectures arent very interesting, but he loves questions and helps u a lot., this is the dictionary for this class.\n keep in mai  (mind)\n beeecos      (because)\n eeef         (if)\n rai          (right)\n all-rai      (alright)\n midten       (midterm)\n ooKay        !!!\n elise        (at least)\n birs         (birth)\n proben       (problem)\n banews       (bad news)\n diffence     (difference)\n mechanisen   (mechanism)\n swim"
Loc Lam,/professor/2548623,4.4,78%,2.3,"He is one of the best, if not the best, professorsa very well-structured class with great lectures. His projects are good, and exams are kind of hard, but he gives review questions, which makes it easier to pass. Overall great guy. Take him without any hesitation., Prof is nice and approachable but flies through lecture slides & doesnt post slides or notes so its hard to study on your own aside from textbook. Can retake your first exam and theres extra credit. Review questions are very similar to exam which is really helpful. I passed but Im not sure how much I actually learned., I cant use the word to describe his kindness. He will help you with all the problems you are facing in or outside the class. He will also give an extension for the project if asked. 2 midterms drop the lowest one. Final exam similar to the final review. Funny Professor in sjsu ever. Dont think too much just take his class and no regret., CMPE30 with Professor Lam was a super easy A or A+, just review the lectures and practice. Review questions are similar if not the same as the exam itself, and class projects and labs were not so bad. He also drops lowest midterm so if you screw up the first midterm you have another chance to shine the second time, making the class easy after all., Literally the easiest class at this school. I dont know how you can get less than an A in this class unless you cant read, cant type, or are chronically sleep-deprived and depressed because you got dumped by your online e-kitten last month., Good lectures, one midterm & a midterm retake (takes the highest score of the two). Weekly quizzes and multiple choice questions on exams. 1 EC project near the end of the term as well. Hes very nice and helpful for learning C., Hes so nice! Exams were taken on lockdown browsers on your personal laptop. Lectures were a bit confusing at times. Easy to get in contact with. Homework assignments were average- not extremely difficult. Definitely recommend!, Professor Loc Lam really cares for his students and wants them to pass with the best grade possible. Midterms are similar to review sessions, easy class as long as you pay attention and attend lectures., You WILL do badly the first time you take the midterm, but thats OK. The class averages over the years tended to be around the 40-60s. But he will let you retake the midterm, so take the opportunity to go over what you did wrong. He will often give extensions for projects if asked; projects can be hard though was probably a skill issue for me., He is great and knows what he is teaching. I had no prior experience but he made the course easy to follow and I learned how to code in C. There will be labs every week. So get prepared to work! His test review sessions are very helpful for the test as they are very similar to them. He will also give a make-up test before the final. I recommend him, Weekly quizzes, good lecturer, very lenient on deadlines and will extend if you need more time. Allowed one midterm retake and extra credit project., His class seems very difficult and he seems pretty intimidating at first but his class is very easy to pass and is very approachable for help. The class is very test heavy but they are mostly multiple choice and fill in the blank so a few days of studying is enough to do well on them. He also gives a retake midterm and drops the lowest one., He is awesome! Lectures are fast but effective. One mid-term, which can be retaken. Lab assignments and quiz are every week, which is hectic but very helpful to understand the materials. Make sure to do them, because it helps a lot for the tests. He also gives extra credit before finals which is very helpful to raise your grade. I recommend him!, pretty easy, weekly quizzes, 2 midterms (he drops ur lowest score), goes over midterm & final questions in the review he does the day the exams, randomly takes attendance but his lectures are worth it, Flies through the slides expecting you to understand them and doesnt upload the slides. When class failed the midterm, he refused to curve and had us retake it again in which average was still low. ASM is difficult and he doesnt explain concepts well. 4 projects and the extra project was tough if you dont know C. Was willing to extend deadline., 1 online canvas quiz per chapter. None of them were particularly hard as long as you read the chapter. 1 midterm(1 possible retake), and final. Both were fairly difficult and reviewing the tests was not available for most students. He had a pretty strong accent. Around 4 coding assignments. He gave an extra credit assignment. He will help if asked., The prof teaches quite well and we work on a lot of the projects in class during lecture. The exams are closed note and on lockdown browser in class so you have to be very good with the material to do well. He allowed a midterm retake because of how low scores were. Also his ta takes months to grade projects, This Professor teaches better than any other Professors who teaches cmpe102. But however, his exams are very difficult and hw/projects and pretty fair. He takes roll calls making attendance mandatory as it reflects your total grade. I would recommend him., He is very understanding and supportive towards his students! Take him you wont regret it., There are only a few programming assignments, a final project and a final exam. Put a lot of effort on the project. Make sure to actively take notes and review for each lecture for the final exam. If you really want to learn, program miniprojects for the concepts taught in class so you are prepared for the exam. If you do these, you will succeed, Pals, this professor is pretty awesome. He teaches you real things that you need in the real industries. Take notes, they are very useful even outside school. For sure he is funny and respectful. Just show your respect back by coming to the class, taking notes, and asking questions. You will definitely get an A then., Hes a good professor. 3-4 programming assignments and a final group project that he goes over well in class. Also a written Final that is comprehensive, but fair. Cares about you doing well in the class. Is helpful when asking for help."
Sayma Akther,/professor/2926663,2.9,45%,2.6,"This is a great professor.  Make sure you have some study habit developed for the class (as with all other courses) and you will be fine., This professor puts a lot of effort into teaching students CS correctly.  This class is for syntax, and it also teaches how future CS classes will be - you need to have initiative and learn on your own as well as in class.  This was by far a very easy class, but if you find it hard, just know that it is not the class that is the issue., Amazing professor.  Easy class, just takes the same amount of effort any average CS class would.  100% should take her, the other reviews must be venting for poor performance (which frankly is a personal issue)., Avoid her at all costs! Otherwise take at CC! \nNot nice\nLectures rushed, hard to grasp key concepts\nLack of engagement outside of class\nNever responds to emails\nAttendance is strictly monitored, roll-call system, need to be extra attentive so that you are marked present. \nFinal exam unrelated to the material\nExtremely low average\nNo curves, Avoid. Speeds through lectures, didnt know materials for the final exam (copied from ap cs), exam was out of syllabus, refuses to curve (despite a D average on final). Questions had typos (refused to fix). Doesnt answer emails., Speeds through lectures so make sure you take pictures of slides. The learning speeds up really fast, so maybe try learning java before taking the class. Retook my midterm and it was so much harder than the original. Shes nice but midterms are all on paper and you need to write code out without checking it., Kind and caring professor, however speeds through lecture slides. You will spend more time copying code down during participation exercises. Reading quizzes and two long homework assignments outside of class which are not difficult. Some questions not taught on exams. Fairly easy to get an A in. Not the worst professor, but not the best either., Easy class, however I have a lot of complaints. She has no presence in the class, she marked me absent for no reason THRICE and I lost 9 points for it. And especially this: she gave a question of a topic on the midterm that she NEVER taught at all. I spend most of my time in class copying code. Not the worst prof, but I def wouldnt take her again., Very very nice teacher, possibly the nicest Ive ever had. However thats where it ends, she teaches in an implicit way assuming you have prior knowledge to the subject (which I didnt) and most of class is spent copying the code she wrote on the board for participation exercise. Textbooks can be accessed online. Simple class, Wouldnt take again., She is a nice person, but teaching is not at that level. I had to watch online videos or some other sources to understand content. Grading was lenient and curve is applied to exams if class average is low. There is a group project that runs all semester long. If you know python, group project will be easy for you., Overall okay. Lecture slides are good. Participation is copy examples than hands-on coding. syllabus has not much info. Prof. is kind/understanding but softspoken. The grader grades all, scores can be negotiated. exam qs can be unclear, only 3 hw for practice.  If u have CS experience, attend every class, + seek extra practice, this class is for u., Teacher has absolutely no presence in the class, her teaching consists of showing code on the board and making students copy them down. And the midterm will be much more difficult the. What we went over in class, good luck!, She is never a punctual professor. She always comes in at least ten minutes late to lecture. On top of that, she speaks so soft that people in the back can barely hear. It does not help that she moves around the classroom too when lecturing, so not all of us can hear her., great teacher and does care for you, but the main issue is that she has inexperience when it comes to writing tests and listening to student feedback. She is a good person but not a great teacher., Took during her first semester. It is clear that she cares about her students success. If you have any idea how the field of CS works, you will greatly appreciate her coursework. It is a great intro for beginners. I brought prior coding knowledge to the course. If you are a CS major and cant do this course, consider switching to something else., Professor Akther is one of the best CS professors you could get.  Take her class - if you are not catastrophically lazy, unmotivated, or incapable, this course should only pose a moderate level of difficulty. \n\nRemember: CS does not get easier from here - if you cannot do 46A with Professor Akther, consider changing your major., Often late to classes. Attendance doesnt matter. Easy A. One midterm, but no final exam, just a project., Lectures barely covered the material, had to read from textbook to understand better. Activities basically just copying her code, wasnt helpfully in understanding the material. Only 2 homework, some of the questions had stuff we didnt learn yet. If you have previous coding experience you should be fine. Her first semester, hopefully gets better., Lectures were light and not in depth. The activities she gave during lectures sometimes forced everyone to scramble for the answer and you wouldnt really learn. Homework sometimes had super hard problems for no reason. \n\nFall 2023 was her first semester teaching so hopefully it gets better from here and all her problems change., Well, the class was for CS 46A, and it was quite literally one of the worst and directionless teachers Ive had in a while. It seems all over the place, doesnt prepare people, especially beginners, much for coding as lack of help is provided and its a chore to understand and process the lectures. The only reason I passed was my prior knowledge."
Faranak Abri,/professor/2824127,4.1,81%,2.8,"Lectures were very educational. There were a total of 2 midterms (each worth 20%) and a final (worth 25%). There was a lot of hw on Zybooks, which for the most part was easy, but also annoying. The professor gives out a lot of extra credit opportunities (max of 5%). The lab section was alright but it can be a little confusing sometimes., Good at lecturing but its really up to you to be engaged or not. Midterms are definitely difficult and no practice exam provided (unlike prof. tsao). Hw is also difficult and long. Offers lots of extra credit. Better lecturer than tsao but tsao provides similar practice exams, may be easier to get a better grade in his class., Pay attention to the in class activities she uses them in midterms/tests. no actual study guides which is sad, Dr. Abri is truly one of the best professors. Her lectures are extremely informative, and the tests are great.  Even if you are not super happy with your score, theres a lot of extra credit for those who go the extra mile to learn & understand the concepts. Great lectures, generous grading, and an overall wonderful class. 100% take her if you can., Sweetest teacher. 2 midterms, a lab exam/multiple choice. Lectures are loaded with info, but due to time constraints she glazes over some important topics. Dont have to attend lecs, but she gives bonus points for attending sometimes. 5-10% grade cushion if youre struggling. lets TAs teach some concepts, if u have tanmay hes the goat, Great lectures, though it sucks that you have to pay for zybooks because thats what she used, but as long as you understand the assignments this class should be a breeze, but unfortunately I had poor study habits that semester., The professor is difficult to score better and gives alot of homework.Its difficult to clear this class., No need to bother showing up to class (its optional) zybooks will teach you all the content. The first 2 weeks have a massive workload but the rest is ok. The worst parts are the tests that just have you regurgitate mostly useless info and have no curving (despite massive failure)., Easy class and gives lots of extra credit. Overall does a good job teaching, though some times she can be convoluted. I found her accent to be tough sometimes, but she seems like a nice person., She is explaining the course subjects in an easy way. Giving bonus points up to 5%. Midterms are from the lectures and in class activities. Lab exams are coding questions with acceptable complexity., Mostly learned through zyBook assignments, more than her lectures. Dont procrastinate on zyBook assignments, they could be a lot to do in one night. Exams were mostly multiple choice, not really coding questions. Will provide mock exams for the 2 midterms, they could be useful for actual midterm, some questions are the same., Super easy if you understood 46A  / CSA. Practice exams were VERY similar. Homework is easy but annoying. Super clear slides and textbook, you can definitely skip lectures if confident. Mandatory lab component is easy but does take time off your Friday. Lot of extra credit opportunities (5% max). She is very kind and lots of TAs to help as well., Professor Abri is a kind and friendly professor. She cared about her students and tried her best for everyone to get a high grade in the class. The midterms were fair enough and they covered the materials in her slides with the in-class activities. 5% extra credit is given based on participation and others. Would highly recommend taking her class., If you did good in 46a or any related course this class should be a free A. Didnt go to a single lecture besides the first one when she told us attendance wasnt mandatory. All the learning is through zybooks. A low effort class but still make sure you understand what youre learning. Free 10% extra credit, OK Lecturer but easy to get a satisfying grade. Gives LOTS of extra credit opportunities and its a free 10% onto your grade, also grades pretty generously on the free response parts of the exams. Also isnt too strict and pretty lenient about issues that can come up during the semester, and gave a good amount of homework extensions, An okay professor compared to the other professors in the CS department. Gives lots of extra credit opportunity, homework pretty long sometimes, midterms are hard to study for as she doesnt provide much guidance and her lectures are either ridiculously straightforward or convoluted and confusing. Be prepared to teach yourself some things., Very nice professor, lenient on extensions and offered a lot of extra credit opportunities. The class used an online textbook that we would use during class and labs. Only complaint is I wish we would have done more coding on Eclipse, I felt that the lectures were rather textbook heavy. Overall a very good class and professor., Prof. Abri is excellent. I did CS 286 - Advanced Topics in CS under her this Fall. But the course code is not listed on RMP. She gives a lot of opportunities to somehow show her that you are interested in her course to get credit. Would highly recommend if you are into Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing. You learn beyond the syllabus., Pretty good professor. She tries her best, offers lots of extra credit and often asks for feedback. The lectures are pretty decent, and most exam questions are pretty similar to the homework., I believe this is her first year teaching and she got a pretty big lecture class. Very nice teacher who cares about her students. We had a discord and she would ask us if we need an extension as there is a lot of homework assignments. Overall, good class and good professor., Tons of extra credit opportunities. Also gave class-wide homework extensions, and tests are only on what was taught in class. Easy to contact via discord/email. Uses the textbook as the primary source for lecture info and teaches slow enough for most people to understand."
Jenny Lam,/professor/2190672,2.3,28%,4.2,"I dont get why so many people struggle... maybe because they dont show up and dont ask questions. Be a proactive learner and youll succeed., Great!, I think professor Lam may have gotten off to a rough start - shes a new teacher after all. This year was pretty good though. The tests were easier than what I expected based on the lectures. It really seemed she cared that we learned the overarching concepts. If you dont understand in lectures, go to office hours. Shes brilliant one-on-one., Got a 100 on CS46B and CS46A Final, Approach teacher takes is super confusing. Would not recommend taking this class unless you have a lot of time to do self studying., She will seem nice in the first instance but as the semester progresses, you will start hating the class because it gets so boring. There are way better choices out there so utilize your school time wisely. Good luck!, Professor needs to clear her concepts before teaching. She can never answer students when they ask questions. ALWAYS her reply will be shell get back to that question after FINDING OUT and she will never GET BACK. Her class is a torture. Not recommended at all!, I would say this is the toughest class I have ever taken. The professor looks cute though LOL., Medium difficulty. Dont listen to the other students whining. The class is super passable, just do your homework and study., Avoid this professor!  Run as fast as you can!!  She looks nice but somehow changes to another person when grading papers. To me, it is okay to have those irrelevant lecture topics and HW Qs. The worst thing is that she does NOT know how to explain things clear, the only thing she does is trying to confuse you.  Be prepared to learn by yourself., Didnt explain things well. Lecture, homework and exams are irrelevant. Good person but Bad teacher, NOT recommand., Nice person but not good teacher. NOT recommended. Lectures  useless.  Slides  confusing. Homeworks  confusing, hard and lightly similar to what taught in lecture. Tests  hard, tough grader.  Conclusion: Take any other professor if possible., Dont ever take this Professor if you want to learn. She is so confused all the time!! I can already feel Im gonna struggle in future classes because i dont understand what she teach. Good luck if you are stuck with her., Professor Lam seems unprepared for lecture.  She spends too much of the short class time either writing out non-essential text, erasing and rewriting, or frozen while she thinks about what to say / do next.  Her exams arent too difficult. Just make sure you study what youre supposed to know and there wont be any curve balls / trick questions., She is a good teacher for actually learning the subject, but a vary bad choice if you desire a good grade.  Tests/quizes are graded harshly and what few extra credit opportunities exist are limited to improving the minuscule homework section of your grade., Worst professor ever. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone. The material is irrelevant and important topics were not covered in the class. Professor is unable to explain anything well. Lecture notes are very disorganized., Avoid this class at all cost. There is no learning in this class and the exams are too hard. Teacher assigns so many readings that are impossible to do and the lecture is not organized. The material is interesting if taught in a good manner but professor makes it too boring and is harsh with grading., Professor Lams lectures are not relevant to the syllabus. I will not recommend her., Dr. Lam is the worst instructor that I have ever seen. The things that she should improve: class notes, assignments, exams, clear explanation. Her class notes are the worst. She dont even grade assignments in time. She ask students to use Piazza, however, she take too long to reply on any post. I would not take her again."
Angus Yeung,/professor/2021381,3.0,43%,3.8,"Awesome prof! He has extensive industry knowledge which makes his insight interesting and worth hearing. Hes humorous; likes coming to class, even on a Saturday. Its not one of those classes where you just learn BS CS concepts that u feel will never get applied. After this class, a student is ready to take on an entry-level mobile engineering role, I wish he can just jump into the coding area and explain the abstract concept while coding. Nobody will understand the concept without real examples, so its kind of wasting of time. Learning how to code in Android Studio is the point.., Good professor. Does examples in class, but you have to teach most of it yourself. Lots of reading, homework is hard and time consuming, and the class average on the exams was a D. He grades mostly based on programming assignments, as I got a D avg on both exams but an A- in the class. Some extra credit. Dont take if you have a loaded schedule., A great professor, humorous, knowledgeable. His ppt lecture is of best quality in SJSU, very organized and clear.  No extra credit, but he is lenient with final curve and assignment deadlines. As a senior manager in industry, his lecture is very practical. 5 HW, 1 Project, 1 Final. Dont under estimate the workload, final project are time consuming, Have to learn by yourself.  The project is super hard and you will never get a hint how his lecture is connected to the projects.  I have been taking notes and listen carefully,  but still do not even know how I should start my homework and project.   Also strong accent, really hard to follow., I took it awhile back and feel like I can clearly rate him. He never talked about multithreading for iOS. As a learning CS student (not grad) I mistakenly done all my code on the main thread. This meant I save to SQL and other computational task on UI Thread. He never even discuss it. Clearly he does not give much effort into his class., His lectures were long. Good lecture slides. However, accent is SUPER hard to follow. I just dont find it fair to follow a hard subject when the professor is hard to follow because of his accent. Slides barely covered enough materials to do the projects. I find myself having to self-study. Last, his administration skill his very poor., Nice guy very knowledgeable and lenient with deadlines. 4 HWs, 1 final, 1 group project using all the concepts we learned in class. Thats it. HWs are simple and final he reviews a lot and gives many of the questions beforehand. Wants students to do well and is not trying to ruin lives. Accent can be a bit hard to understand., Uses high quality lecture slides and assignments to help you understand the material and prepare for exams. Exams were straightforward wminimal surprises. Lectures were boring. Did not seem very prepared during his lectures bc he tends to not explain most concepts thoroughly and reads off the slides. Expect to mostly self-learn."
Layla Pezeshkmehr,/professor/1698263,1.9,N/A,3.5,"Projects are completely separate from lecture and test material, but are more applicable to software development. Lectures are straight from slides, and the book has some errors that make the assignments confusing (same as her instructions for HW, tests, and quizzes). Have to learn some things really well to do well on tests., Professor Pez is super unclear! She forgot to put half the directions on the test, and class average score was F. She try to be nice, but very hard grader. Your answer is either wrong or right - no partial credit. Lecture is very boring - she just read slides. Lots of homework and group projects. Projects are unhelpful. Not a good networking class., If you truly want to learn sth. about networking, don\t take her class. Her lecturing style is dull: She just reads from slides when lecturing. She hardly answers student questions. The material is next to useless-far from applicable-for anyone wanting to do net. prog. or net. setup/maint. Though I got a good grade, I regret taking her class..., Despite knowing most of the content for this class she is regularly unprepared for class. Her lectures slides are from another source and is almost word for word in the book. Youre best off reading the book than attending class. Projects are straightforward but expect little to no input from the professor. Feedback on returned HW is lacking too, Easy course with projects that can be useful if you try.  Best approach is to read the text then go to class only if youve questions.  Fairly difficult exams, but its manageable., Last day of class and nobody has any idea what their standing is in the class. She doesnt explain anything in class... goes through prefabricated slides very sluggishly and without any of her own insight. The first review is right -- I dont think she is qualified to teach this class. Dont bother with class... Just stay home and read the book., shes not so bad and tries. i think she knows the subject., she wont help you with hw or in-class questions. i dont know if shes qualified to teach."
Tejaswini Karra,/professor/2575872,2.1,25%,3.5,"I really enjoyed Professor Karras class. We learned so many concepts within the software development lifecycle and tools that we would use as a Software Engineer. This class is heavily team dependent but as long as your team puts in effort, youll be able to create a great application for your resume!, Honestly learned a ton in this class. The coursework isnt heavy & depends on one large group projects your happiness will depend on the quality of your team. Shes a decent lecturer but I really liked how she focused on tools & concepts used in industry today., shesNice but sorry she doesn\t know how to teach, she seems like she doesn\t know what she\s doing, lacks so much confidence, says um kinda sorry all the time, she\s very hesitant when explaining things so nothing sounds credible. I know this is harsh but it\s true, I could understand better and save time if I just read the slides by myself., If you want to completely self study OOD, this is for you! As others have said, she\s too busy with her other job to even remotely care about teaching. She once said, This is a foundational class for CS. If you\re struggling with the material in this class, you\ll find that everything in CS & Engineering will be difficult. So encouraging!, She is literally so bad. Doesnt know how to teach. A lot of the students has a different background with OOP, she expects us to know everything. She uses Dr. Kims lecture notes. Doesnt explain clearly no in-class examples or any sort which helps us understand the material. Exams are also difficult, questions which she didnt teach comes up., Pros: Cons: - Too busy with her other job to teach us, tells us to go read the book on our own time - Condescending tone if you ask question she thinks is basic - Not good at explaining abstract concepts - *Sigh*, Shes a nice enough person but my god, she cant teach at all. She always lets us out 30-40 minutes early because she apparently cant be bothered to teach and her class is an utter mess. No one has any idea what is going on or what topic is being covered or what she wants us to do, we just sit there confused. What a waste of my time and money, What a terrible class. She gives ZERO examples and just monotonously reads the notes off the board (that arent even hers!). Gave out such a difficult exam and project in the first month of class when we barely learned anything. She doesnt know how to teach or how learning works, do yourself a favor and please dont take her."
Sanjoy Paul,/professor/2659813,3.0,50%,2.8,"One of the most caring professors iIhave ever met. The materials are hard, but he tried his best to make them simple to understand. The exams and quizzes are often long and would have to rush to complete, but they are all open book. As long as you understand the material and complete the HW you should do fine in the class., We had weekly quiz, two midterms, bi-weekly mini-project submissions and a final exam throughout. An extremely caring and respectful professor who tried to break down and teach complex concepts to its very basics, with clear lecture notes and an amazing teaching style!, Dense lectures. Quizzes every week. Homework is completely irrelevant towards exams, so you will have no extensive preparation for the exams except for reviewing lecture slides., Professor Paul is a decent professor; material is theory-heavy and can be difficult to follow. Review lecture recordings in your free time, otherwise youll be lost. Lectures cover way too much material. Quizzes are tough but if you pay attention in class youll be fine. Exams are difficult and homework is easy. Homework doesnt prepare for exams., absolutely terrible professor. reads off the slides, fails to explain many concepts, test format is horrendous (Canvas exam where you must keep scrolling back and forth to see an image and must type your answers -- including drawing graphs), Theoretically heavy and dry class, no coding. Respectful old style teacher. Very caring to his students, helpful in and out of class. Extremely experienced, passionate, and professional in networks and related fields. But expects a lot from students, super long exams and quizzes in limited time. Cant finish them without working in a group."
Jorjetta Jetcheva,/professor/2676520,4.8,100%,3.8,"Hands down one of the best professors in the department. Very knowledgeable and caring of students. Gave great lectures which were recorded. No textbook use and assignments were based on google colab notebooks. Grade based on 4 assessments with multiple re-dos allowed. Just make sure to make use of each attempt. No final if you pass each assesment, Amazing teacher! Have taken another course under her after completing 255. Just have to be sincere and you will get an A/A-. She allows you to explore the subject without making you worried about grades which is great. Responds to emails within a day. Encourages class participation., Very useful concepts but the lectures were too abstract. The areas of artificial intelligence and data engineering could have been explored a bit deeper. She introduced us to RASA, a conversational AI platform, and Neo4j Knowledge graphs - very practical and trending stuffs to learn (power to your resume). Overall, a good class., She is one of the best professors that I came across at SJSU. Gentle and introduce a lot of concepts in data mining and make you learn. Very useful homework. Lecture heavy but overall good learning. Very prompt to student queries., Prof Jorjeta is extremely underrated. She teaches every concept right from the basics and has a deep understanding of the subject. She gives out weekly assignments where she strongly recommends collaborating with others although it has to be submitted individually. Exams syllabus is from her slides. You will learn as much as you put in the effort., Absolutely amazing !!! So heres how to go about her course... 1. Tells you a lot of new concepts, algorithms, and lets you explore extreme corners of each of the topics. Best to know all the concepts/algorithms beforehand so that you can actually go and understand each and every corner case. Recommend watching YouTube for concepts before class."
Jim Mildrew,/professor/1900137,4.9,N/A,2.2,"I like this guy, Best professor learned a lot, I wish he would teach upper div cs classes, Prof. Mildrew Is one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. His lectures are clear and so is the criteria for grading. He is especially knowledgeable about C programming and cares a lot about the success of his students in his class. Make sure to show up to class and study the power points for tests and quizzes. Great teacher and nice guy too!, Great Teacher who is very willing to take time and speak with his students about the class and/or other academic subjects. Great teacher all around, though he did skim over one subject a little too quickly causing confusion on the midterm. Aside from that, a very solid teacher and would love to take another course from him again., Great professor! He understands the material and takes the time to explain it in his powerpoint presentations. His assignments are not too difficult and his quizzes are pretty easy. Take this professor if you want to learn C and not stress out while doing so. I would definitely have him as a professor again."
Michael  Finder,/professor/2024953,4.9,100%,1.5,"Not just another CS professor teaching game development, but an actual game developer teaching game development. You can tell hes passionate about teaching and the subject through his lectures. Explains material through on the spot examples, making concepts concrete. Will know most/all video game titles you throw at him., Amazing teacher, one of the few that actually cares about the class he teaches. It was inspiration learning from a teacher thats so passionate about game development. A real nice guy and very helpful. I put more time into this class and the project (I made an endless runner) than any other class Ive taken at SJSU because I loved it so much., Great class! The professor is really engaging, and really loves the teaching about games., Hes one of those teachers you just know they are passionate about what they teach. He is smart and can answer pretty any question related to games. This class is not hard but it does require effort because creating a game engine is a bit different than what is usually taught here at SJSU."
Leonard Wesley,/professor/2192627,2.7,34%,3,"Attendance is mandatory for In class assignments. Exams and quizzes are open book. Very bad teacher. You will have to teach yourself most of the things. Assignments are extremely vague. No one in the class can figure out what kind of answers he wants. This was an introductory bioinformatics class, will definitely not recommend him for any class., Do Not Take. Incredibly disorganized: he canceled 60% of the assignments in the syllabus and published no notification of this to students. He excused this by saying he was busy doing research for his second Phd. If he is the only one with open sections, just wait and take it with someone else. 350 chars is not enough to describe how bad he is., Amazing professor! Dont miss any courses that he offers"
Zeyu Gao,/professor/2386906,1.7,0%,3.7,"His lecture is the slides and his answers to questions are not clear. Every single assignment including the group projects is graded by TA even the group projects and midterms are graded by computer since MCQ. Not sure why he is even in class since he even let TA do demos and dip early himself. Even for HW questions, he tells students to ask TA., Hes knowledgeable but doesnt know how to teach. Hes really unclear about what he wants for the project, he gives teams an A for doing 22 test cases but gives your team a C for doing 40, in essence, hes never happy. Tests are hard. Homeworks are difficult and take forever. Ask him questions, but youll never get a concrete answer. Avoid him pls., Projects are good but documentation heavy Lectures are not good and outdated Other class is good but your grades will not suffer with professor Gao. Draw diagrams to impress"
Tazmina Sharmin,/professor/2832179,1.0,0%,4,"dont walk...RUNNNNN from this professor..\nShe is very disorganized to say the least. Her lecture slides are confusing and seems like she doesnt understand the material she is teaching very well..The midterm was EXTREMELY LONG and she did not take students feedback into consideration.\nDo yourself a favor and take someone else if you can., DONT TAKE. Unprepared: unfamiliar w/ online tools, got confused by her own lecture slides & gave shallow answers to questions. Jumps around the syllabus & tries to assign HW due 15 mins after class. Made up the project as she assigned it w/ vague specifications & kept adding more requirements before it was due. Brushed off criticisms with excuses."

Gerald  Benoit,/professor/3020820,2.0,0%,3,"The instructor presented real-world scenarios and encouraged creative thinking. However, the course lacked direct instruction, relying on students to self-teach from videos and readings. The Canvas platform was also disorganized. He did not update grades when Canvas quizzes marked correct answers wrong, even though screenshots were given."
Maryam Khazaei Pool,/professor/3065699,5.0,100%,4,"This professor has interactive lectures that combine teaching a concept and applying what you learned in groups. She is very caring and will help anyone who asks for help or clarification. This course is generally difficult, but she provides you with every resource you will need to do well in her class.

David Taylor,/professor/214947,2.7,31%,4.5,"just listen to the rest of the reviews on here.., Avoid at all costs, only grades in his class are the midterms and final. Programming assignments are helpful but if you dont get a perfect score, itll hurt your grade. If you dont get at least a C on the final, you fail his class., Very difficult and horrible professor. Avoid taking him to save your GPA. Strongly recommend taking CS 49J instead of suffering through CS 48 with him., Hes the hardest cs professor in the school for a reason. Not impossible to do well in the class, but youll be dedicating lots of time studying for the class. Your grade is solely determined by the maximum grade of your final and the two midterms combined. Dont take this professor if you have other difficult classes., By far the worst professor I ever had. His class is incredibly hard and most students fail. Even as a last resort, do NOT take him since he does not prepare you for his own exams. If you are in his class, drop if you can and save your GPA., If youre looking to get a grade higher than a C in this class, look for another professor. Think twice before taking Taylor., He is an unforgiving grader who gives complicated lectures and does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept. Unless you are extremely good at CS, I would highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Honestly if you want to really understand data structures and algorithms this class serves. Although it is a difficult class, the material is not bad and the assignments really help you grasp the concepts. If you go to his office hours he is always willing to help, you just need to make use of the resources., Do yourself a favor and pick another professor. Very harsh grader and bad professor, period., This guy made me hate my life for 4 months. 4 MONTHS. He gave me an academic strike for using an online solution to one of his assignments even though like half of the class did the same thing as me. Nobody knew how to solve it. That shows how bad of a professor and guy he is. Strongly recommend taking CS 49J instead of having to suffer with him., NEVER take a class with this guy. He always speaks to students in an intimidating and condescending tone of voice, even when they say hello to him in the halls. He should not be teaching anymore because when it comes to grading, he treats his students like theyre his worst enemies., The worst professor I have ever taken! He made my life miserable for 4 weeks! 4 WEEKS!!! I felt like my life was over. I am taking Vidya right now and her class is much better. I hope this guy gets karma for what hes done to me and so many other students (not horrible but like at least where he understands his mistake)., The only things that are ever actually graded are two midterms and one final; all three of which are hard. I highly recommend avoiding this professor., His teaching style did not work for me and many others since ~90% of students do not do well in his class. He expects people to ask questions they do not understand and lectures from there. No graded exams/assignments until the LAST WEEK of the semester. His philosophy is that you won\t worry about your grade and instead focus on the material, Do NOT take this professor. He is incredibly rude, intimidating, and condescending towards his students. Also, a good amount failed his class due to his impossible tests, yet he does not realize that hes the problem despite so many failures. This class was a waste of time and effort., Avoid at all costs! Your grade is only based on the final, which is extremely hard. Hes the issue, not the study habits., Do NOT take this guy. Ever. He makes students cry when they do not understand something and takes sheer delight in making their lives miserable for 16 weeks., I legitimately HATED this professor. He seems like an evil guy who actively likes seeing other people struggling and hurt. He rambled about how to be a good coder while providing nothing of value, assigned extremely hard coding problems, and never told us how to do them even though we were literally just learning Java., Harsh grader, makes students feel dumb by speaking to them in an intimidating and condescending manner, and your whole grade is only based on the final. Good luck., Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 146 professor available when I signed up for classes. I regret not waiting because his class was hell since he made me and my classmates cry by making us feel dumb when he did code reviews with us as he was very condescending and intimidating., Do NOT take a class with this professor. He is the toughest grader ever and is not that great of a teacher. Your grade is only based on the final exam., Terrible instructor. He does not even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how SJSU would hire someone this bad to teach. His exams are over-the-top hard as he thinks this is the only class students are taking. He also talks to students in an extremely condescending and intimidating manner. Please do students a favor and fire him., I cry every day being in this class with this professor. The fact that most students do not pass his class shows how bad he is., If I could give negative starts I would! This professor is legit the worst. He grades with no leniency, and even if you try, he will still criticize you and make you feel dumb. I was miserable every day being in this class with him. Do not take any of his classes. If you do, drop immediately. Do yourself this favor by not suffer through his classes, Dr. Taylors teaching style just did not click for me. He posted YouTube videos that we had to watch before class so he could ramble during lecture time about whatever. Your grade is only based on the final exam, so watch out. I highly recommend that you do not take him if you have options., Worst workshop instructor ever. I never took a workshop where the instructor was so unwilling to help students. I strongly recommend that you avoid taking any of his classes., The most difficult professor I have ever taken. Usually even with bad reviews I manage to get no lower than a B. This class isnt like that. Its very challenging and the only way that you can even get a passing grade is if you spend hours and hours preparing. Any other professor is a better choice dont make this mistake., He is THE WORST workshop instructor ever. He just rambles all lecture and does not give us hints, resulting in the class period ending before he can give them hints. The difficulty of the course is also very inconsistent. Go to the CSSL or get a private tutor for a lighter load., If you take his class, you will know exactly the definition of a nightmare. He does not teach anything but keeps talking about whatever it is. He grades so harshly, and your final grade is based on the final exam. Believe it or not, the majority of the class fails his class. If you want to challenge yourself, take his class., Do not take this guy, hes a really bad teacher as he is merciless when it comes to grading. He also speaks to students in a very rude, intimidating, and condescending manner. If I could do it again, I would have taken a different professor., Extremely difficult and unfair professor. His rote exams and final exam are very hard and he failed a good amount of the class. He simply does not prepare you to pass his exams, is extremely unfair, and you will regret ever taking him. Stay away at all costs., Do not take him EVER. Even if hes the only one open for that semester. It will really hurt your GPA if you even pass. Your grade is only based on the final and he just talks about whatever during lecture time. He needs to grade better or get fired., The people giving him good reviews are just glazers. Like where do you see him teach the class. He doesnt go over the topics needed for the class and just rambles on in lectures. Tests are challenges as well as the programs and he expects you to know the material form the class automatically., Taylor is a relic that needs to be uprooted from his tenure status. Your whole grade is based on the final, which is HARD. Also, he is very intimidating and condescending when talking to students. Think twice before taking Taylor. He may be a nice guy but avoid taking CS 146 with him since he does not prepare you for his own exams and assignments., I was NOT impressed with his class. He says that CS 146 was hard before he got to SJSU, but the truth is, he makes the class way harder than it needs to be. Also, his tone of voice is so intimidating., For the people giving him good reviews let me explain. His teaching his fine but his grading system sucks. U dont even know your grade throughout the entire semester which means in the last 2 weeks your gonna be stressing out a lot. You have 2 rote tests back to back and a final right after. Theres barely any room for a mental break., Taylors reputation on this site has tanked a lot recently for no reason. Hes one of the only professors in the CS department who chooses to teach rigorous material AND treats us like we can handle it instead of pampering us. For people who want to actually learn/are into math, hes one of the only options you have to learn this subject., Take any other professor. Even though they have bad reviews at least its easy to pass those classes. If you are taking upper division CS class for the first time I recommend not taking him. He will drain your grade and most people that took his class fail., Its pretty bad. Theres a reason why most upperclassmen recommend you avoid him unless you have a particular talent for coming up with algorithms., Does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept and skips multiple steps when teaching. Very condescending. Loves going off topic and rambling about whatever., I couldnt think straight for 3 weeks as I had a chance to fail. He knows his CS stuff but a horrible professor. He doesnt even teach the class right and expects people to know the material from his videos. The only grading is the test and he even takes of parts of ur grade for code if you dont get certain amount of points. Worst grading system!!, Worst professor in the whole CS department. He may be knowledgeable, but he grades so harshly and is not that good of a teacher. Do NOT take him even if you delay your graduation., The teacher does not care about his students. He has decided that he is not going to explain concepts and just talk about whatever during the whole lecture period, yet he grades like someone is trying to get their Masters in CS. Unless you love CS and/or want to have a miserable semester, I highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Theres a reason why all the other CS 146 professors classes are full for the upcoming semester. He is the worst professor I have ever had because he grades so harshly and talks in a very intimidating tone of voice with students. So, it would be best for students to wait until Spring 2025 to take the class when they have options., My 1-unit class with him felt like at least a 3-unit class. Individual teachers have lots of freedom with how they teach. They have certain things they are required to cover, but how they cover them and what extra content they add to the course is up to them. This is why his class was hell. Additionally, his tone of voice was so intimidating., If you cannot afford to wait another semester to graduate, take this class. If not, then look for another professor., He is THE worst professor I ever had. Avoid him like the plague, especially if you need to take upper level STEM courses or have other classes., Only take his class if you have A LOT of self-drive. You will self learn this whole course (with some assistance from his videos). Lectures were only worth attending if you had questions from videos. Has all tests in last two weeks. Code reviews give good feedback, not sure why people say hes mean. Also has a weird cult like student following., I like Taylors in-class lectures; they are entertaining and informative, like when he talks about his experiences. However, this class is extremely difficult, especially in the last week, where I was brought to tears. Others have already brought up how hard this class is, and they do not exaggerate. He can be condescending during office hours too., His grading style is just the worst. I strongly recommend taking another professor for CS 146 to avoid a nightmarish semester., The course and exams are easier than people say it is. Unconventional course structure, requires a lot of self awareness and discipline. However as long as you understand the material, the curve guarantees an A. Got a D+ on the rote exam and an A on the final. He has a very specific way of structuring questions, difficulty is definitely overstated., If possible, take easier prof + watch Taylor\s vids to learn more.\nOptional lectures unless you have questions. Low workload until 2 exams in last 3 weeks. 4 simple programs. Do HW weekly, review all vids a week before the rote + make practice Qs. Final is harder, definitely secure B- on the rote (which he shows the exact questions for)., Your entire grade is based off the midterm and final. His exams are very difficult and his YouTube lectures are hard to understand for a student new to this content. You actually do learn a lot but its because you know you will fail if you do the bare minimum. You have to decide for yourself if this amount of stress is worth it.. for me, it isnt., Worst professor ever! Honestly doesnt even care and makes his class so hard. He grades based on 2 things and they were both so hard. Made me really depressed pls dont take him. Looked at the classes available and hes the only one available wonder why. And what is with these reviews who cares how he teaches, its ur grade that matters., Prof. Taylor is the only 146 prof. who sits down with each student for code reviews. This is very helpful if youre ready, and terrifying if you arent. Yes, he grades on very few tests, but do all the optional HWs and youll do ok.\n\nYou probably wont get a great grade, and youll really have to grind, but youll be a better coder for it. Trust., Honestly the worst prof ever. Theres no way anyone can be this bad. Looking at the other professors I wish I had taken them instead. While I agree I learned a lot in this class his grade was based of the rote test and the final which were so hard. Never thought about actually failing a class till now. Please dont take him avoid even if ur smart., AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Not for the faint of heart. Save yourself some pain, suffering, and time by finding a different professor to learn DSA. Learning the material is challenging but not too bad. His grading system is horrible. DSA is a challenging class, but he unnecessarily complicates it. Would be better off taking a different professor., He is terrible. He literally claimed that our one unit class would be a cake walk and gave us a midterm that not one person could get credit on. Also, most of the things he teaches is unnecessary. Not only that, but all he knows how to do is talk as he makes videos that actually hold lecture content so he can ramble all class about whatever., He is one of the worst professors I have ever taken. If you take him, just know that your entire grade is based of off the final. He also makes a six figure salary, he really can care less about the students., He may be a nice guy, but as a professor hes terrible. He goes WAY too fast and talks WAY too much. His teaching method and grading style do not even make sense becuase your grade only relies on your final, which is SUPER hard. An understanding of covered material is simply not enough to get a decent grade., It is interesting that he likes or enjoys students suffering. If he wants to be a better professor, please listen to students. Stop covering up and do your job. Do you know how many student graduations/lives you have ruined? Students have depression because of him., Very tough on students. Lectures consisted of Youtube videos and class was all on advanced things. If you get lost you would have to work super hard to catch up. Code assignments took me an absurd amount of time and he has very high expectations of everyone., This is the worst professor at SJSU hands down. I have never been in a class before where I walked out more confused. He is a terrible professor because he talks too much and does not provide novice programmers any insight on how to code. I am so sorry if you are stuck to take him., The toughest and most intimidating professor Ive ever had. Do NOT take his classes. His material is good but he makes his exams SUPER hard. Homeworks do not help much for exams. CS 146 is already a hard course but he makes it way harder than it needs to be., David Taylor is a hard professor. He was called the gatekeeper/weeder because he failed half his class. I highly recommend you take someone else for CS 146., He is an unforgiving grader who gives complicated lectures and does not care if students pass the class or not. His teaching method and grading style do not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept. Unless you are extremely good at coding, I would highly recommend not taking this guy for CS 146., Your grade is only based on the final and he is super rude and intimidating. He should not be teaching anymore., The worst and toughest professor Ive ever had. He is so intimidating and condescending. I still have nightmares from being in his class and my parents had to take me to a psychologist to help me deal with my night terrors., One of the worst professors Ive ever had. He was so tough and talked WAY too much during the 50-minute class period and he typically ran out of time to give students hints for the weeks assignment before the class ended. The difficulty of the course was also very inconsistent., Usually I take RMP reviews lightly because most people will only speak on their bad experiences but TRUST ME WHEN I SAY HE IS GENUINELY A TERRIBLE PROFESSOR. Talks too much and does not provide any insight on how to code. Extremely hard professor for NO REASON. Avoid at all costs., Professor Taylor was not equipped to teach CS48. We only had 50 minutes for lectures a week and he was terrible at time management, often rambling and running out of time to give you hints for the next assignment before the class ended. The difficulty of the course was also very inconsistent. Take CS49J instead for an easier class, Extremely difficult professor. Doesnt teach in class so you have to rely on his somewhat confusing youtube videos. Coding assignments are difficult with unhelpful feedback. Rote exams are challenging and final is so hard that some students didnt even try to study for it. Take someone else unless you want to take a risk., Hes a nice guy, but his exams are extremely difficult. He curves very hard so you will most likely pass if you put time into studying, even if you get a really bad score on the exam (my 43% became a B). Make sure to spend time on the programming assignments as well, I slacked off during the semester and lost some points on those., Very easy class to pass if you put in the effort. If youre trying to get an A, good luck because his final is extremely difficult albeit the curve is super generous. This is a DSA course, not a technical interview prep course. Be ready to learn about abstract topics that you will probably never touch again. Hes pretty funny too., His homework is challenging yet highly educational. Offers two preliminary exams with a maximum grade of B-, which can be superseded by a better final exam score, he wants everyone to pass his class. Provides personalized code reviews for each student, enhancing understanding. An excellent lecturer, though the material is inherently complex., Terrible professor, I am quite surprised that he still allowed to even teach a class at SJSU. He is the toughest grader ever, talks WAY too much, and does not prepare students for technical interviews., Taylor is a relic that needs to be uprooted from his tenure status. Your grade is only based on the final and he grades so harshly. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE AN OPTION, ANYONE ELSE!, Drop while you can. I had no choice than to take this professor and I thought that if I studied enough, I could make it through. Worst decision. He grades so harshly, talks WAY too much, and does not provide insight on how to code., How is this guy still employed at SJSU? I hope they get someone else to teach 146 since this guy is a joke and his tests are not reflective of the material taught in class. He grades so harshly that students do not have a chance of passing., You are given the exact format for two rote exams, which are capped at a B- on a curve, and one final which is also curved but uncapped and you do not have the format. He is a good teacher and as long as you do what he recommends you do at the beginning of the class you will pass easily. Try to get in as many code reviews as possible., He talks WAY too much and does not provide much insight on how to code despite the fact that the students have little to no coding experience., You will actually learn the content of the class if you take Taylor. The homework takes pretty long, consisting of optional videos and quizzes, but if you take your time to do them, youll do great in the class. Hes very helpful, will answer anything, and is always available. Your grade only consists of your final, which is something to consider., Flipped classroom style takes some getting used to but it is really helpful for traversing the content at your own pace. HW is difficult but allows you to really get an idea of how well you grasp the content. He is passionate about teaching and explains things in a lot of depth (sometimes too much :P), Its HARD. Homework is ungraded (def. still do it for practice) but grades are determined entirely by 2 exams (and you lose part of your grade if you dont finish programs you code throughout the semester). Curve was fair to me. Flipped classroom style, HW lectures are on YouTube and are generally solid. In-class lectures are interesting. Good guy., He talks too much and does not provide a lot of insight on how to code, even though many of the students have little to no coding experience., He might be passionate about the subject, but he talks waaaaay too much. Sometimes takes too long to get to the point. His teaching style is average, doesnt get straight to the point. Need to spend a lot of time on watching his lecture videos., I learned more from this class than any of my previous ones. There are a few major programming assignments, and he goes through multiple rounds of code review and feedback to help you solve the problem and improve your code. It was a tough class, but he really cares about making sure you understand the material., I took him a couple semesters ago and overall, the experience wasnt bad. If he ends up teaching CS 154 again, just know that you will only be graded with 5 tests, 3 of which are extremely difficult. The final does replace all your test scores, and the curve is extremely generous as well., Crazy difficult class, but I cant say I dont feel prepared for upper div CS classes., This class is flipped classroom style, but keep up with the video lectures. Class time is used looking at problems to build intuition for various concepts, so attending class is worth it. The programming projects give good learning experience. Overall, the class is hard, but theres fair grading, and its curved generously. Be ready to learn., David Taylor is a very respectable person. A very understanding human and will absolutely help students when asked. What you gain in this class depends on how much effort you put in, and dont worry about your grade too much, itll probably work out in the end. Ask questions about the videos and make sure you put in an effort on the homework., Ive had Taylor for CS 146. He is a little goofy, but is serious about the material. The subject it self was not too easy, but he give his own created Youtube videos to explain the concept visually. There are some program assignments, 2 rote exams, and 1 final. He give good practice exams for the rote exams. Very helpful., Work hard, memoize the sweat, and tears(yes, this class will make you weep), which then leads to an optimal grade. \n\nHe will also unlock coding secrets in your path to becoming a rockstar programmer!, Graded by only three tests, Professor Taylor is someone who will go the extra mile to make sure you understand a concept if you go and ask him about it, a lot of people are confused on specific topics and thats okay, but if you do not ask to elaborate then you will get nothing out of the course., Tough class and tougher grading, but you learn a ton. A lot of people give Taylor a disproportionate amount of hate because this is the first hard class they take in college., This guy is unneccessarily rough and does not prepare you for technical interviews. Its way too theoretical and not enough leetcode-type prep. Honestly, if youre thinking youll take him cause he\s the hard one, but he\ll prepare you for interviews, then you\ll just get an unnecessarily hard and theoretical class with none of the interview prep., Would find a different professor if I was you. Didnt really help me excel nor pass the class. Draconian style of grading not suitable for everyone, No textbook, just his provided notes. Join the discord and ask questions cus his class is difficult. 5 exams (50%) and 1 final (50%). If your final grade is better than class grade, it will become your new overall grade. Exams are very difficult so he curves. If you put in effort, you will probably pass but an A will be very hard., He is a unnecessarily tough professor. Does not prepare you for technical interviews. In that view Id definitely find a different professor if I was you. Hard to pass his class even with hard work., Dr. Taylor is an amazing professor. We will mostly learn algorithms through videos at home so that he can use class time for discussing interesting problems and answering students concerns. About the rote exams, they are easy. However, the final exam is extremely hard, so make sure you study the material after each class and avoid falling behind., Professor Taylor is very experienced in algorithms and if you want to learn the theory behind them, take him. But, there is not enough practice, and if you are preparing for interviews, prof. Taylors approach is not really helpful. There is too much in-depth analysis and some topics are only covered theoretically, with no coding exercises at all., Horrible. Best to avoid him. Luckily there are other options. Choose wisely, He really makes sure; exams are harder so you wouldnt pass the class. Exam-based class. Exams are super harder and you will never get basic or simple questions on the exams. Please take another professor. Sometimes, it feels like he loves to fail students, Taylor has a good mindset, and tries his best to teach. Hes sometimes confusing, but hell be happy to explain what he meant if you ask. Funny at times too, but tests are hard! Make sure to study his notes and more., Ok prof. put in the work, n ull get the feedback. tests r hard but manageable., Took him last semester, extremely tough professor with unclear grading schemes., first few weeks of class he complains about his past students and how dumb they were. Tells us the AVERAGE of test scores in the past was 30%. Has a specific answer key on Canvas; he puts in one or two answers and if they don\t match, full points off, e.g. extra space, tells us its because he\s too lazy to grade by hand and it\s not his fault., Taylors great teaching comes at the cost of a lot of hard work from the students end. This is by far the hardest class I have ever taken so far, and I sincerely recommend thinking twice before taking this professor. Also, dont cheat because he will catch you., He goes above and beyond. His videos provide a great visual intuition on how algorithms work. He assigned four coding problems, and gave individual code reviews for each, always providing very detailed feedback. Homework is hard but useful. It doesnt directly affect your grade. By far the best class Ive taken., Hard, theory-based class. Taylor really makes you work for your grade. Grade is 50% exams, 50% final. Final replaces the exam grade if you score higher on it than your exam average. No chances for extra credit, but Taylor generously curves. This is one of those classes where your goal is more to score better than others than anything else., Professor Taylor is a real gem. His 146 class is an opportunity for students to learn important skills for technical interviews and improve their coding / critical thinking capabilities. Attend his lectures, watch his videos multiple times to ensure you understand the content. Good luck and enjoy yourself, his class is the best youll take at SJSU., Grade is 50% exams, 50% final. Follows the teaching philosophy of failing half the class, then curving the median to a B., This guy won\t prepare you for interviews, because he\s gonna go over all of the theoretical parts of CS that aren\t needed for interviews. On top of that, you won\t learn to implement any of the algorithms that he teaches, you\ll just go over theory behind them. Finally, his YouTube channel, which has his lectures, are super unwatchable., a lot of people say hard but you learn a lot they are tricking you! you can learn a lot ant not torture yourself and thats what gets mistaken. the concepts in 146 are cool but are less cool when you are based on 100% grade weight on final., Passionate for subject. Can be mean when asked questions. He created a Discord for his class, but its better without professor since its easier to ask classmates questions. Confusing instructions on some homework and assignments. Canvas page difficult to navigate and grading criteria unclear. Hard enough learning online and he makes it worse, Entire grade based off of two final exams, one is a safety net (max grade B-) and the other is the actual exam. Both curved. Take a lot of notes from his videos. Dedicate your entire being to his videos and the algorithms. Dedicate. Everything., The worst professor. Does not know the material. Sometimes sets wrong answer key for the exam which is why my points get deducted on the canvas. Logically try to prove that my answer was wrong when my answer was absolutely right. Honestly he is not a good professor. He does not teach what he gives on the test., Baby boy... I get youre trying to make the class challenging.. but the classic giving easy problems on the homework/practice and ramping it up on exams to give the class a harder time? Its getting so old. Its tired. Showing us examples of the type of problems on tests is not taboo. Please do better., Do your best and dont cheat on his programs. If you cheat, he will find out. 4 programs, you will do code review (office hour 5-10 mins per visits) for credit, else 0 credit. Prepare to learn a lot of algorithms, time complexity etc. 2 rote exam 1 final in the end. He give exam practices which is very similar to his actual exam, you just study. GL, Best c lass and best professor I have ever had. Course consists of very well-done video lectures, and engaging in-class problem solving. Projects were well-defined, and auto-testing makes feedback near-instant. Tests were difficult but fair. This is an excellent prep class for the real-world of SW engineering., Sure, this is a very challenging class, but that should be what is expected for algorithm design and analysis. Interesting algorithm problems are discussed in the class. Took both cs146 and cs155 with Prof. Taylor, found his classes to be the most rewarding among all the cs class I ever took. He curved generously in the end., The class is tough, but you\ll learn important algorithms things that you won\t get from any other course -- it\s the hard part of CS that you can\t really learn on your own. Exams are difficult and are the basis of your entire grade, but he has a very lenient grading scale (in our case we only needed 20% of total exam points to pass the class)., Taylor is definitely a very knowledgeable professor and you can learn a lot from him, but his teaching style is not for everyone. He explains the main concepts but you have to research and learn from other "
Suneuy Kim,/professor/90503,3.8,66%,3.6,"at the time of writing this review, i think this was her first semester back? but anyway, the lectures are very important and should be used as review. the programming assignments suck the life out of you so be prepared for that. the coding questions on her exams are not that bad but the multiple choice screws you over if you get it wrong, The homework is way too hard and her slides are not very helpful either. You have to figure out everything on your own because she isnt very willing to help with troubleshooting either., The course is useful and you can learn quite a lot from it. The only downside is that she doesnt respond to emails., Her tests are fairly ok if you just read the lecture notes. The coding questions are really easy but the multiple choice questions are sometimes ridiculous and you will lose a ton of points if you get them wrong., Good professor. Lots of assignments but helpful to solve them., The content you learn is helpful in your development of java. She has a bit of an accent so its a little hard to understand her sometimes but her lecture notes are sufficient to learn from. She also allows you to use her lecture notes when taking the exams. Her assignments are a bit time-consuming but helps with learning the content., Too much homework,Crazy Crouse, The hw assignments were big & time consuming, but didnt feel relevant to class content. Very lenient grader for hw, not for midterms. Great lecturer, worth it to come to class and ask questions. Group project depends on groupmates, if theyre bad and dont contribute, you wont get an overall good grade, but your individual grade will be ok., Homework assignments were decently challenging, but doable. Midterm and Final were actually straightforward if you go through the slides very thoroughly. Group project was graded very leniently. Overall, the class wasnt super difficult but you do have to work for it. As for the professor herself, shes very friendly and caring. Go to office hours., Exams are pretty tough, but it is open slides. Some homework is easy, and others take much longer. Graded generously. Team-based project is pretty easy. Every team got at least 93% on it this semester. Lectures are pretty thorough but dry though. She is really helpful when it comes to asking questions, office hours, and email., Lectures are very clear and easy to follow if you listen to her lectures and do assignments you will pass the class. Its a hard class but she grades very generously to compensate. She tells you what will be on the exams during the lecture. The only downside is that assignments are important and time-consuming but worth little for your grade., If youre good at programming you can skip her lectures. Her TAs are extremly lax with grading on both programming and midterms/final but the programming assignments are relatively large. You have access to the notes during the midterms/final which is really nice. There is a group project and you might have to solo it if you have bad teammates., Professor Kim was really understanding and caring especially during the pandemic. She spent a lot of time for each lecture making sure everyone understands the concepts. She really wants you to succeed in the class and truly tries her best, even removing a topic so we have sufficient time to grasp all concepts. Definitely recommend!, Shes a nice person but a strict professor. Midterms are not open notes and are based on powerpoints with 70+ slides each. Homeworks take FOREVER so start early. Homework is only 10% of your grade and the rest are exams and project so make sure to study hard for them. Like the other comment, just try your best. Good luck, Her online style of teaching wasnt the best but just do the homeworks and try your best on the exams and you should be okay, She definitely knows what shes teaching. Exams are kind of tough but doable if you paid attention in class and did the homework. If youre looking to get a good understanding of DBMS, take Kim. The students who left bad reviews were the slackers and did the bare minimum., It felt like Professor Kim didnt really care about her students and was just tone deaf to everything going on. Her exams were super tough (class averages are Ds), she doesnt let you use notes, and her lectures are extremely dull. Lowest midterm gets replaced with final exam score if its higher though., One of the single worst professors Ive ever had. The slides for each chapter are overloaded with information (60+ slides) and she tests you on 4 chapters at a time for the exams. Doesnt let you use a cheat sheet or anything , expects you to memorize everything, lectures are super boring and monotonous, and overall Id never take her again., Her lectures are really boring and I have a hard time paying attention. She goes really fast and her midterm questions are really specific if you dont have a great memory. I thought her hw assignments were long but not really difficult at all. Just dont procrastinate. I wouldnt take her again., Kim is perhaps the best choice for database class in SJSU. No fluff, gets right to business. Explains clearly and methodically. Comprehensive tests: no long hard problems but virtually all little details of the material taught are covered. Weekly online quizzes, 1 pencil-and-paper homework, midterm, final, group project. Highly recommend., I have never scoff at me until I took this class. I constantly felt patronized for participating in class. Be ready to be asked many rhetorical question, and do large homework assignments where you are given no feedback and are no aid to the tests., I think this is her first semester teaching Nosql, hence, things can be inaccurate and messy at times. The assignments have out-of-class topics that you need to do more research in order to do them. Her instructions to install mongodb, aws are also kind of out dated. But this is her first nosql, he does try her best to explain the concepts in class, The first few weeks move a bit slow, but then it picks up from there on out. Grading is very picky on exams; final will replace lowest exam grade (if higher). Lectures move pretty quickly - be sure to ask questions if you need to. Kim is available in office hours and, though I did not attend any, I can see this was a mistake. Read, do hw, ask qs., Kims a great lecturer and teacher, especially when it comes to explaining theoretical concepts. However, her exams are tricky and she grades a bit strictly at first. But, she does curve in the end. She also replaces the lowest midterm score with your final exam score if you score better, so dont worry too much about failing one midterm., Dr. Suneuy Kim is an inspiration. Shes incredibly caring about her students and genuinely wants you to succeed. Always approachable. Answers every question. Very clear lectures., You have to go to class and pay attention in order to well on her tests although attendance is not mandatory. One drawback i see is she is not really helpful through emails if you want to ask questions. However, she is helpful in her office hours. The group project is realistic and fun to do, If you attend lectures and take good notes, all youll have to do is skim the textbook. 4-5 coding assignments and a group project. Midterms/final are mostly handwritten coding problems, but she allows an 8x11 cheat sheet (no code allowed, though.) Gives study guides for midterms. No random quizzes. One of the best in the CS department., Kims CS157A is much easier compared to her CS151. Homework is all online with answers posted on many githubs. Group project takes a large chunk of your grade but was graded easily. Just dont wait until the last minute. Midterms and Finals are mostly based on her lecture slides and should not be too difficulty if you understand the slides., Kim is hands down one of the best in the CS department! Professional, caring, and knowledgable. Her lectures are packed with info so attending class is important. The pacing of her lectures can be inconsistent- Be sure to pay attention or youll easily miss something. Easy midterm, difficult final, and group (of 3) project that could be solod :), Took her summer session course. It was intense because of the short 10-week time span. Programming assignments are very time consuming, but you learn a lot from them. Exams are tough, and she deducts quite a bit for minor mistakes (triple-check your answers). Groups are assigned for project. Curves class grade if necessary, but doesnt announce it., One of the best professors Ive ever had! She cares so much about her students and encourages everyone to ask questions frequently. Her hw assignments were very time consuming and tedious but really reinforces the material taught in class. Tests arent hard as long as you study and come to class. One group project at the end of the semester., A lot of the concepts have been discussed in CS46A&B as well as CmpE 131. I wish she would have focused more on GUI and interesting programming techniques, but given she uses a book from Horstman you can\t expect much. Mispronounces technical terms and bangs on the white board. You will hear her say Focus a lot, homework is ample, so start early., Kim has a sweet and endearing personality that helps carry you through the material. Lectures are organized well but take notes because the slides alone are not enough without her added commentary and notes. Tests are challenging but fair - make sure you study the slides and examples from lectures. 2 tests, semi weekly hw, 1 group project., I enjoyed Dr. Kims assignments and lectures. Her hw assignments are not difficult, they are just tedious but they apply well on what were learning in class. Her exams are not too bad, theyre based on lecture notes and you get to have a cheatsheet which is convenient. Loved the group projects. I learned so much in this class. Thanks Dr. Kim 3, The best lecturer and professor at SJSU! This is the only class I really learned in Spring 2016. She respects her students and treats her students equally no matter what level you are. She makes me feel so good after the exam although her exam is super long and hard. She tried her best to help you especially at the end of the semester., Very very good lectures. Class is extremely fast paced so dont even consider skipping class. Assignments are extremely time consuming so make sure you start as early as you can. Exams are also extremely challenging. You really have to work for your grade. She is at the same time a very motherly and kind person so use her office hours!, She is such an amazing lecturer! Her lecture notes are very clear. She introduces knowledge clearly and gives very good examples.  Coding assignments perfectly reflect the content and also is helpful for exams too. I am an EE bachelor to pursue CS master and taking her class as prerequisite. I am very glad to take this course, it worth the time!, She is such an amazing lecturer! She can go pretty fast at times, but if you pay good attention in class, take good notes, and study/understand her lecture notes, you will do just fine in her exams. Coding assignments are challenging but completely doable. I learned a lot in her class and I love her teaching style!, Kim is a great professor, lecturer and person. Shes very helpful, thorough and always willing to answer questions. Assignments provide almost no hand-holding and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment when you finally complete them - you will not want to put them off till the night before due date. Tests are also challenging but rewarding., Very fair and helpful. Very organized and no surprises. There is a group project in the end, in which you have about 6 weeks to do. She assigns the groups so no-one ends up alone. Highly recommeded., Definitely agreed that Kim is one of the betterbest CS professors on campus. Her lecture notes, grading, and assignment expectations are all crystal clear. Youll have to work hard to earn an A, but youll also learn quite a lot. If you get stumped, make sure to ask her questions: shes a nice person!  4 HWs, 2 midterms, 1 group project, One of the better teachers in the CS dep. Theres a lot of content and she goes through it thoroughly; open to questions at anytime and is very approachable.  Tests can be difficult. Asmts are reasonable and relevant. She gives you every opportunity to succeed if you work for it, if you fail you may need to rethink think this major.   1010 WTA, She doesnt care about students or respects them. She makes up a ton of ridiculous rules and doesnt lose a chance to deduct points. If you ever have to argue with her, good luck! Shes so full of herself that she just wont accept other people can ever be right. The material is easy and she tries to include a lot of useless info in lectures., Good teacher overall. She gave tests on Fridays for all sections at once (including the final). Language barrier is occasionally an issue, but usually shes pretty clear. Assignments generally arent too difficult, just make sure you give real time and effort to them. In tests you can bring some notes., I think Kim is one of the better CS professors on campus. She really cares about how youre doing in the course. If you pay attention in class and get help when needed, an A is quite manageable. Some questions from her exams are taken from the lectures and you can find an example of her midterms online. Exams are long so manage your time., Kim packs her lectures with information. Shes full of energy and passionate about teaching. I enjoyed her DBMS class and learned so much. I would definitely take her again for another class., I love her class., Excellent professor. Very clear, but midterms are rather hard. Study regularly and early, and you will probably do fine. Smacks whiteboard frequently for emphasis. May tell a cheesy joke one or two times during the semester for practice. Slightly unclear/inconsistent about late policy, which cost me an entire assignment once. Look out for that one., Outstanding lecturer.  Knowledgeable, organized, very well prepared, engaging.  Read the book, go to class, do the homeworks, study the notes - you will do very well and learn a great deal.  What more can you ask for from a prof?, All I can say about Professor Kim is excellent. There are many HW compare to others Professor but it is good to learn from that.Exam is challenge. I learn a lot from this class, thanks   pro Kim., Having Kim back from leave is great since she is a good teacher. Assignments were engaging as well as fun to write. However, I found her lectures to be a bit dry at times. Also, her midterms were a challenge given the time limit. She does let you use reference sheets on all tests but I feel she could structure them better. Nice lady overall, She explains well and covers all the material clearly, but she goes fast and covers a lot every lecture. You should read the book in advance so that you can follow and get the points she tries to make. Dont start the assignment late, you can get full scores on them with basic attention to requirements. Tests are challenging., Professor Kim is really calm and relaxed and is approachable for help. She will notice if you slack off in her class or if you dont show up often. Her tests are hard, but she covers everything in her lectures or homework. The homework is tedious, but she tells you exactly what to put and will regrade if necessary., She really knows Java. Her notes are amazingly helpful, sometimes its even better than the book! The assignments are easy if you study the books examples, and her tests are based on her notes. I learned a lot., I couldnt study any of my other classes because of the extreme homeworks., Shes a good teacher, but her tests are challenging. Dont expect to use a laptop during your tests because you dont. Its all pen and paper with her tests. However, with her homework assignments, she tells you EXACTLY what you should do. Just follow the instructions. Overall she does explain everything in detail. There are quizzes so go to class., The lab assignments are just waist of time because her lectures and labs are totally different. I think she should use the lab time for home work assignments., Avoid this teacher if you can. Her lectures are really hard to understand and her home work assignments take weeks to complete.If you need help,the line for her office is way too long, and by the time its your turn,time is over.Also,the midterms are way too hard, if you dont spent 24 hours on doing the homework and assignments, you will not pass, Professor is well prepared with her lectures and has a perfect time management. She reiterates important concepts/ideas and helps students while working on the assignments. Fair grading. Recommend this professor., If you do not have great programing experience, you will not pass her class. First of all she does not understand that cs 46B is just intro to database, she wants you learn how to write code from scratch (implementation).Secondly,even though if you understand the lectures, the home works are really hard and time consuming.Dont take her., Taking cs46B with Dr kim is just waist of time! Her lectures are really fast, and her home works are hard, and long.Most of her quizzes are based on the home works, so if you cant get the home work done, you basically done.Drop the class as soon as you can!You wont learn anything and you will end up with a D., Very helpful.Highly interested in teaching the course and making students understand the material.Homeworks and exams are easy if you understand the lectures., Avoid this teacher like the plague. Her lectures are really hard to understand and goes super fast. And when you ask a question, she just repeats the info that you didnt get. Its hard to understand what she asked on the homework and marks points down for silly things. If you can, choose a different teacher., One of the hardest computer science professor ever. All her home work and lab assignments are really abstract and does not match with the lectures., CS46B is definetly an intimidating class. I really didnt learn anything in 46a and was not prepared at all. I failed all the programs and midterms at first, but Dr. Kim really helped get back on my feet. She is really helpful and her office hours are a blessing. Just do all the assignments and you will be fine in the class. Curves at end of semeste, Extremely intelligent & helpful prof. in CS department! Her lectures are comprehensive. Advice: Dont miss the lecture. You can understand alot by reading lecture one time before go to class. Programming and exams are OK!. Final is comprehensive. If you study well on her notes and class lectures, you will be fine. Thanks, Prof.Kim, read her notes before coming to class, she will do what she can to help you, she will use every minute of her class time so dont expect to go early, midterms are hard, but if you realy pay attetion are duable. no one really gets good grades on the 1st midterm so dont stress, do all the programs and group project make sure u have a good group, good professor, tough midterms but they are doable, tries hard to give students complete understanding., A good teacher. English needs work, and it shows on the midterms. But if you do the homework and understand it, youll learn plenty. Midterms can be challenging, but actually fun., She is a good teacher. Lectures are very good. Class notes are good(mostly from the book). The book is questionable. HW/Assn are easy and dont prepare you for the exams. Exams are too long and redundant, yet skip some important topics that were covered in class. I *did* read the book and got even more out of the classes., A bit challenging.. Lots of homework and labs. Very difficult tests and quizes. But something about her makes you want to try to impress her and show her how smart you are. I like this lady., I took Dr. Kim for 2 semesters. She is super nice. She is glad to help you in every way she can. She doesnt curve. Her lecture is a lil bit confusing. Her assignments are kinda hard. Her midterms are harder. Her final is ok. I hate the textbook. Dont rely on the textbook too much. You can study everything from her., im not a big fan of programming. but she made it worse! she has a thick accent, and you can tell english is not her first language. in fact, the lectures sucked. homeworks are not related well to lectures. and she doesnt understand your questions. take the class only if you want to teach yoruself from the book., professor kim is a great instructor.  she is clear and she makes sure she emphasizes the important points so that it will stick in your mind.  It definitly will help in the future.in the beginning of class, you may be frustrated with her repeating things...but towards the end, youll thank her for it.take her for 46a/b, she give u strong foundation, She is not clear, teaches things that arent in the book, expects you to know things that arent in the book and havent been taught, uses topics chapters ahead of where we are, has very hard homework and exams, moves way too fast.  I dont think she realizes this is a BEGINNERS course!Only the people with programming experience can follow., This teacher sucks! She is not that good at explaining things. But more importantly, you know those teachers that you ask a question and they got NO idea what you talkin about, but lecture you anyway? and on top of that, her step by step directions for the labs are terrible! and you gotta fuigure out where they went wrong youself. do NOT take!, A very very helpful professor. She is very patient and will answer the same question till everyone in the class gets it. Wish you were teaching CS46B this semster Dr. Kim., Very nice professor. Very intelligent and provides the slides she uses for her lectures on her website. Therefore, it is a lot easier to study for her exams. However, her exams can be very difficult as they test major details from the concepts you learn. Her assignments shouldnt be difficult if you took CS 46A seriously., A teacher in whose class you WILL learn a lot, assuming you want to pass.  Not the best choice if you want a slackoff class (actually a very bad choice).  Lots of work, but if you do it all, Im sure youll probably get at least a B.  An A would require higher understanding though., excellent teacher. you will learn something if you take her class. explains very clearly. Thanks Dr.Kim, teacher who takes her job seriously. she stresses herself too much though, and it can be nervewracking when she bangs the board to convey a concept. way too much muddy details, sometimes following the direct format of the book, needs to narrow the topics down. tests are from dantes hell., Very nice teacher. Does a good job at explaining concepts but tends to not go into implementation in detail. Assignments are all implementation of concepts rather than use of them. Spent lots of time at office hours, helped GREATLY and was eager to do so. Tests are very difficult so know your implem, Gives very explicit details in her programming assignments, but doesnt give you the tools to accomplish it. Office hours prove benifical if you understand some of it. Hard to program when all she teaches is the concept and not the example code to help you implement the idea, clear but super difficult, This teacher is great! She is very descriptive and goes through here work in detail; however, her tests can be a pain because they have trick questions. If you really want to learn Java, take her but if youre looking for a class to get by then dont take, her lectures were well organized and helpful. If u could get pass her accent, u dont even really need to look at the book cuz her lectures teach u everything u need to know for her hw and tests., She presents slides and everything to help you, and is really clear once you get used to her accent, She was one of the best teacher I ever have in SJSU.  She was clear and organized.  She was not the kind of professor who just read the text back to you.  I learn so much in her class that I had a easier time in CS46B and highly recommend her!, i took with her CS46A and CS46B, she is hard, clear, but very helpful, I recomend, Organized, boring at times. tests are fairly hard. accent can be a small problem., Outstanding teacher, took her last semester.  Her exams are crazy, crazy hard but she curves to make it fair.  I would take her for every class that she teaches in CS.  Learned the most from her., sign up for her class, no problem., She tries to help you understand the material as much as she can, but half of the time, her words are so off sometimes, I have no idea what she says.  Quizzes, midterm, and final was CRAZY hard., Very clear instruction, but the quizzes, midterms, and final are insane.  Tests you on subtle, complex stuff.  The lab exercises are out of sync with the book/teaching, so its almost like taking two courses simultaneously.  10-15 hrs/week outside class., good teacher... but hard midterm, I do not suggest this teacher for an introductory course in Computer Science, you will feel the long term damage of her ineffective teaching methods in upper division., HARD MIDTERMS.. other then that teaches pretty good.., Wants you to learn. Helpful outside of class. Hard midterms, very nice person and helps u out; hard midterms though"
Marty Froomin,/professor/62007,3.2,0%,3.3,"Lost my respect from day one., Love ya, Marty!  Keep up the good work!, Hes my hero!  Keep on rating yourself Marty at the site that cannot be named!!!  :), You need the book for the class but expects you to know EXACTLY what he knows. Deviate from that and you will fail the class., Can you say BORING? What a waste of time. I could learn more from reading a book. This is way too easy. It is not college level caliber and neither is the instructor., All this guy does is repeat what is in the book. His testing is not related to what he goes over in class. I totally wasted my time. I cant wait until they replace him., Has no curriculum, doesnt use the textbook 99% of the time, lectures are 80% unclear, entire semester is based on lectures, hes narcissistic, egotistic, unapproachable, and sometimes assigns homework which he has little knowledge of.  Overall, he could use a class or two on how to be a better teacher., This is a guy who was picked on his whole life. Now he takes it out on his students. Sad controll freak. Worthless teacher., This guy is on an ego trip. He likes to act very athoritative, but may be compensating for his short stature, and balled head. You can learn just as much without him....if not more., worst teacher. do not take. EXTREMLY LAZY, Narcissist, anyone? All 50 good comments are written by himself-he admits it 1st day of class. Lectures consist of pointing to pages in book, then testing on random topics hes never addressed. Grades extremely hard. Not flexible. Made me glad for CSU budget cuts-professors like this do not belong in a classroom attempting to teach., thinks he is easy and helpful but he is not. hard grader. expects you to know what he knows., He works at Sun, so he tries to incorporate as much of Sun as he can in the syllabus. He wasted our time in the UNIX class, teaching us Solaris, instead of a simpler and universal version of Linux. He wants students to write exactly what [he] taught and to try not to use their brains (!?). Even if your response on the exam is better than what he, Hes the laziest professor I ever seen. Lot of lab nights. And the funny thing is he use the same quizzes and Midterms over and over for every semester. I got some pass paper from friend and got an easy A for the class. Not recommended if you wanna learn stuff., If you have seen good reviews on this teacher, that must be posted by himself. He doesn\t even feel shame on saying that he would comment himself on this website on our first class. If you just need a credit, but it won\t be good btw, take his class, because the sentence he said most often is tonight is the lab night, you are free to go., The worse CS professor that Ive had. Wasnt able to tell how many megabytes are in one gigabyte. His lectures are all about reading the textbook, he will ask you to memorize stupid commands. Be ready, he tries to make his midterms and finals really hard with questions that he didnt go over.DONT TAKE HIM. You will wast your time., Half of the classes are actually no lecture at all. The lectures are only I will test on you on page ...., I will not test on page .... On the final, there appears something from the pages that he said he wouldn\t test us. No notes, slides, or others at all. He sometimes can\t answer students\ questions. What he said wasdon\t waste your time, This guys a real loser. He teaches for ego boost only. Likes to be in command. Must have got picked on a lot when he was a boy. Actually still looks like a little boy., No Comments, Need to pay attention to lectures. Take advantage of lab time offered. Picky when it comes to grading. Practical final killed my grade. But, he warned me., Interesting to talk to and aproachable. Has a teach yourself philosophy and doesnt lecture much. Very big on following directions and will be heavily penalized for small mistakes. The class was ok until end, when it pretty much fell apart. The final ended up having irrelevant/unfair questions and was worth 40% of grade. I dropped 1/2 grade from it, Not a difficult class. Decide for yourself and go talk to him during his office hours., he is a freaking trainer. He forces you to remember everything (Its purely pointless to memorize the whole book in real world). And he will made jokes thats not even funny. I hate Splaris after I took his classes. Im writing just to make sure people wont be trapped in his classes. By the way, I passed his classes!, He thinks he knows more than he really does. A real phoney., No Comments, He is not that knowlagable., Everyone who is here basically just want to know if u should take him as your instructor...YES. So there., First half was easy. Second half was tougher. Practical was tough but very realistic. Unfortunately I didnt do as well as I thought. Grade really dropped in the second half., Bummer that this is going to be a smiley, because it shouldnt be.  Martys friendly to a fault--CS 172B should be a much harder class than it actually is.  Lots of rote memorization and not enough practical assignments.  Theres a practical final that is intended to put the fear of God into students--really, the whole class should be like that., What I learned to hel;ped me get a job. The grading is tough. Overall I was not disappointed., After taking CS072 and CS172A I thought he was an excellent teacher. However, after CS172B I was very disappointed. The guy didnt teach anything new and every other class there was no lecture but a lab time(meaning i have nothing else to tell you my dear students). Totally agree with the previous statement - review of past 2 semesters!, What a difference between 172A and 172B! Was very organized for 172A and didnt even know what to say in 172B! Invent lectures every class! Have you go over his vaforite VI again, over crontab AGAIN, /etc/passwd file AGAIN and many more other AGAINs! Very disappointing! Basically, CS172B was a review of CS172A!, First half of the semester is easy. Second half is harder. Ithought I knew the material until I took the Practical Final. He taought me everything I needed to do well but I blew it. I shoud have taken advantage of the lab time offered., His lectures can get a bit dry, but he gets to the point.  Its not a difficult class, exams are fair, just attend class and take notes and youll be fine.  Hes helpful outside of class and has a good personality. I would continue taking his classes., This guy does not teach! Every lecture, he keeps inventing new reasons why Unix is inferior to Windows in every way, and how Vista eXPerience will be the final nail into Unix\s coffin.  He even said that we can\t get more than a C if we are not running Windows Vista Beta on our laptops by the end of the semester.  AVOID!, Just want to thank him for the job I got. He mentioned some job opportunities in class. With his help I got an interview. What he taught me got me the job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you., He knows the material. He cares about the students. Sometimes he talks too fast, but he will repeat. Overall he is better than most., Grading is tough. You must know the material. His exams are fair and his grading is consistent across all students. He gives you the skills you need to get a job. There are a lot of whiners out there. If he sucks so bad why is he still teaching. Probably because no one else wants to teach the course., This guy is a joke, you will learn more by yourself than going to his boring classes. His grading is worst than obaid. Could not answer most questions from students and I would not had taken him if he wasnt the only guy teaching. Has no respect to many students. I also know he treats females better and Im lucky to be one. Got a B in both classes., knowledgable guy but is not lenient with grades. midterm and final make up majority of the grade. quizzes and hw are worth nothing in comparision. no partial credit. its either all right or all wrong. he is not shy when it comes to failing lots of people. guess hes on a mission to weed out the weak...take him if you are confident in the subject., This is not a class for fun - definitely not an easy A. You will learn in this class! Marty knows exactly what hes doing and knows his material and make sures you know what is the MOST important. Wish more time was covered on significance of files rather than memorizing which files are where. Cares for his students TREMENDOUSLY!, If you value your grades, avoid. If you value a real education, take him. He is one of the best teachers in the CS department. He cares for his students inside and out of the class. He has experience from Sun. He knows Unix inside and out as well how to teach it. HIGHLY RECONMENDED to anyone who wants to learn Unix., Very hard guy. Grades mostly based on midterm and final. Lots of people failed his class because of the final, so watch out if you take him. Be prepare for midterm and final. They are the most important. Quiz and hw are ok. Lecture not that interesting. Can make your mind wonder off to somewhere else., You will definitely learn a lot about Unix in that class.  Marty probably knows the subject better than anyone else in the CS department, and he knows how to teach it, too.  His teaching style alone makes the Unix Admin sequence worth taking. \n He also helped me fix my Windows laptop after a piece of spyware crashed it dead.  Thanks, Marty!, very good teacher, but grades are mostly based on finals and midterm. If you did bad on the midterm then your only way out is the final. All the hws and quiz dont help much but just to keep u hanging. STUDY ALL QUIZES FOR TEST AND FINALS., No Comments, Bottom line: Your grade in the class does not do justice to the amount you will learn in the end. 70% overall on the midterm and final, and material from courses previously in the unix series frequently show up on exams. Grades efficently (next class day)and is very helpful to students in and out of class regardless of most topics., Good instructor,knows the subject very well and very helpful if you ask questions directly or through email.He grades the papers fast and returns them the next class.Strict grader and no curve means you have to do well in all the quizzes and midterm.Has 30% for one midterm and 30% for final,so need to do well on both the tests to get good grade., a friendly instructor, but he grades extremely strict! ie. no partial credit. Some did well but i guess around half of the class are failing toward the end of the semester. btw, lectures are short, so the rest of the class time is for you to go over stuffs, ask questions or leave., He is a really good teacher. He real cares about the subject. It doesnt hurt that he is hot. :), The majority of this class is being able to do the work. It is not simple memorization. He expects you to know the material. Grades are based primarily on two exams. If you do well on the quizzes, then you should do well on the exams. The practical final is an eye opener. He tests what you can do., This is definitely a class where you have to learn by doing. He offers lab time for us to use and familiarize ourselves with the material. there is no open lab and there are students who choose to leave rather than use the time offered. Oh well, their loss., He may be tough, but I am prepared to get a job. The whiners are the ones that do nothing and expect to pass. If you are not capable, you wont pass his class. He expects you to know the material and tells you exactly what you need to know., His lecture is horrible. He does not teach. Good luck for someone who wants to take his class., Yeah yeah he is good but when it comes to midterm and final he is tuff why when someoneone puts enough, alot of hard work in this class it doesnt mean anything to him.. and people are saying he is good becuase they all pass .., Not the easiset teacher, but one of the most caring towards his students then any other ive seen. Midterm and Final are 70% of your grade, a few programming assignments and quizzes disperesed evenly. Easy to talk to, funny, outgoing, and well one of the best lecturers Ive ever had, Easy at first but then it gets harder. The beginning is easy because he prepares his students well in CS172A. The harder part is because it is new material. He really wants you to know the material and be prepared for a job. He definitely cares., He is a great teacher. Knows the material and makes sure you learn it. Wish there were more like him. He cares more that the full time professors., Froomin knows his subject and knows how to teach it.  Yes, his tests and quizes require lots of memorization, but it is almost crucial when it comes to UNIX.  I would definately recommend taking classes with him.  Hopefully he is around when I take 172b., Highly recommended teacher! Reasonable homeworks and exams as long as you study whats given in class. See him more as a friend level but is very respectable :) Lecture is fun and interesting. Take his class!!!, Bad instructor, midterms and quizes are very long and hard.... shouldnt take him, Acceptable teaching techniques, however the grading does require some well needed overhall.  Very help full through e-mails, as well as his office hours.  Needs to add more than one midterm to his class, because one midterm of 30% doesnt help., Marty is a badass sysadmin.  Take him if you want to know Solaris., A cool instructor who refuses to be called professor and who is very personable...he tests hard...and EMPHASIZES attention to detail...but you will know your UNIX when hes done with you...to say nothing about him bein a bad ass Harley motorcycle rider., Is the great teacher who gives exact or similar previous classesexams and quizes to students? (e.g. Exams and quizes of yrs 2002 and 2003 about 90% simililary).Just ask students who took his 172A for Fall 02 and Spring 03, you will see how close they, Great teacher, probably the best Ive ever had.  Makes the material very clear and focuses on things that are useful in the real world., One of the best teachers at SJSU, he was the reason why I ended up liking Unix so much, Learn real world/useful material. Straight-forward, clear lectures., I look forward to his class. I learn a lot. He makes the material easy to learn."
Chung-Wen Tsao,/professor/2318479,2.1,29%,3.6,"Great professor for this class. If you are truly interested in the subject, you will do great in his classes.  Attending class is extra credit, so you really cant fail this., Great professor.  Amazing with accessibility outside of office hours, writes tests which dont pull material from thin air.  Overall, wonderful class.  100% would suggest taking him.  He started a bit mumbly, like some of the comments said, but he really improved less than half way through the term., Prof. Tsao has been among the worst professors Ive had the pleasure of taking. He is kind, responds to emails quickly, and generously offers extra credit. However, his lectures are disorganized. He skims over key concepts and often makes mistakes in quizzes and midterms. You will learn more through self-studying., Strong chinese accent plus very slow slide reading leads to a very disengaged classroom. Use quizzes to study for midterms, same for finals., Lectures are really hard to understand. Nice person and will respond to you if you have questions. Exams are pretty straightforward but lectures are so boring and youll learn more by self studying. You get some notes on exams which is nice too and makes them fairly managable., The professor doesnt teach well, so be prepared to self-study. If you do, quizzes and homework are easy. There are two midterms, which can be a hassle. This semester, many did poorly on the first, so he held a bonus midterm with two questions from the first one. The final grade was the average of both midterms., Mumbles a lot, does not have clear grading criteria or schedule, goes over class time, would not take him for another class, Has an accent but is definitely understandable, one homework a week which isnt extremely difficult but not easy, labs on fridays which can be easy or hard, responds to emails very quickly, nice person in general and easy to talk to, helps and talks to students if they ask/email, only downside is that the lecture content is boring, Teaching was ok, lectures made me sleepy, participation quiz at end of class. Hes nice, has an accent so can be hard to understand. HW is through Zybook and 1-3 quizzes each week. Only issue were typos in quizzes and tests. All test are compilations of prev quizzes. Lab is chill, lab exams are fine if you have a firm understanding of the concepts., Weekly homework but 2 attempts and sometimes gives answers in class. Lectures are hard to pay attention to, but slides / homework let you self-learn. Midterms + Exams let you have 3 full cheat sheets and are very similar to homework / practice exam, so they were easy. Extra credit to participate. Responds to Canvas fast. Good if you can self-learn., He was going over one of our assignments and then got stuck.. then gave up and just told us to input it in our IDE to get the answer. He doesnt even know the answers to what hes teaching. SJSU do better and hire better professors., He is bad. A bad bad man ., Bad at teaching. His lectures are barely audible and boring. Most of what you learn will be covered in the textbook (ZyBooks), which will be your weekly HW. Theres also a quiz at the end of every class. His tests are manageable, but there are at least 3 or 4 typos in each one. Labs are difficult, but will actually teach you things, Youre better off skipping lectures and just watching YouTube tutorials and doing the homework. The lab instructors are very good in my experience., He is a horrible lecturer, hard to understand, and his lectures are hard to follow regardless. He requires you do homework through Zybooks which costs $100. His tests and quizzes are a mess, hard to understand and full of mistakes. The class isnt hard but that is in no way thanks to the professor., Mumbles quietly to himself while looking down at his laptop during long lectures. Formatting of answers on quizzes are wholly unclear. Slides are contextless amalgams of stuff just sort of happening without any explanation. Clearly has no idea what hes doing and was unable to find a real job. Shame on SJSU for hiring him., Only took him again out of necessity, not a good teacher. Use the class discord & learn from other places.\n\nPros: Responsive outside of class, the difficulty of midterms and final is fair(-ish), quizzes/HW are 2-attempt and show wrong answers.\nCons: Confusing questions/slides, answer key errors, and rough accent/poor English., Tons of zybook hw the first 2 weeks. Thick accent. In class quizzes every lecture, with chances to earn a small amount of bonus points. Midterms and final mostly multiple choice, you can memorize if you want to do well. Final recycles a lot of questions from midterms., He gives lots of HW and quizzes, about 60 of them total, and 2 big projects. Class is super time-consuming and the professor is terrible at lecturing. Gave out WRONG answers for practice midterm. Nice guy and reachable outside of class. But your classmates are better at teaching than professor., Hes chill and not like rude but its hard to understand what he says in class. Use resources. For midterms some of the questions are from in-class exercises so its best to memorize the answers. The first midterm was pretty hard and probably the hardest one. Also he doesnt round grades so if your stuck at a 89.99 he wont round up to a 90., Pros-offers SOME extra credit, pushes SOME due dates back\nCons- unintelligible lectures (we go too fast without any depth so all your learning will need to come from self study on DIFFICULT material for CS 147), dodges questions, swamped with HW/quizzes, lectures do not prepare you for the 3 tests, plz take someone else, Initially when I saw the reviews, I thought I was screwed. Surprisingly he was super easy. If you did well in AP CSA or 46A, this class is a breeze. The midterm questions are from in-class exercises so pay attention to them, and the labs were easy as well. He was also the only professor to give out so many practice quizzes. Super accessible too!, Professor Tsao is a nice guy but a terrible professor. His lectures are difficult to listen to and follow due to his thick accent and mumbling. You have to learn everything through reading the Zybooks which is the online textbook. The class itself isnt too difficult as long as you have a decent Java foundation., You will get more out of this class by doing the ZyBook homeworks, watching yt vids.. anything else. He does not teach well; he reads off slides and is not engaging with the content. Labs every week are chill. Midterms are alright, make sure to do the practice ones beforehand. Shouldnt be a hard class with a decent Java understanding., I cant believe I have to rate this professor again. Attendance required online class where he just mumbles on slides with incoherent scribbling and text. TONS of homework, answers on quizzes/midterm reviews arent even right sometimes, doesnt teach you to use the software for projects. Take a summer course or a diff professor if possible., Professor mumbles through lectures which are unclear and often contain errors. Several pop quizzes (1-2 per day) and homework quizzes that can take 1+ hours to complete and cover information not present in the lectures. Projects are fun, but are challenging since they use info not in the lectures. Tests are easy and mostly follow quiz format., In general extremely rude and angry when youre confused by him. I survived this class by watching YT but no one learns anything from his lectures. \n\nLectures are mandatory w/ camera on, he has pop quizzes, mistakes in quizzes, etc., Lectures sometimes have hard content, can be hard to follow because of mumbling + accent. Weekly homework from textbook due every Sunday. 2 midterms, based on textbook, lecture + in class activities. Provides practice midterms. Labs every Friday, 2 lab exams that are on the same week as the midterms. Decently fast response time on canvas emailing., Mumbles in lectures, but very helpful one on one. Homework heavy, but that means your grade will stay up as long as you do the homework. Midterm 1 is similar to in class exercises, the other is purely coding. If you have a good Java foundation or love coding, this class will be easy for you. Weekly labs will solidify your understanding., The class itself was fairly easy, it is just difficult to understand his accent sometimes, making it hard to understand the lectures if you arent paying attention, but the material isnt anything crazy. Sometimes the quizzes have mistakes in them which can get frustrating but he always fixes it and is very generous with points. Just ok, Terrible professor, I am quite surprised that he still allowed to even teach a class at SJSU. Lectures are hard to understand due him mumbling, slides are not helpful and tests are very different than homework. Homework itself takes 5+ hours to complete and is due within a week., HW is graded for participation except the labs and challenge activities. Learned more from HW than from his lectures, which only make sense if you make time to go through them properly. In class activities/quizzes every class for participation points. Many mistakes on his midterm, one lab per week. Connections are important in this class, Mumbles from start to finish, attendance is graded, and 1-3 pop quizzes after each lecture. Some days, we had pop quizzes, HW, and a lab due on the same day on topics we had just covered that week. If you email him with 1-3 questions, he will only answer one at most. Why is he the only instructor teaching CS 147 for an entire year now!?, Absolute nightmare to communicate with in emails and tough to understand in class. You can be super polite in emails to him asking for help but he often takes a really long time actually answering your initial question and then leads you on a wild goose chase wasting a ton of time and asking way more stuff before he actually answers., Keep mumbling. Hard to understand what he wants to say. Not sure why he became an instructor to teach people if he does not have the skill to teach., He mumbles to himself in class, you wont learn anything from attending the mandatory classes for which you will be penalized if you dont attend. You will have multiple pop quizzes every day and homeworks every week. The midterm exam will be extremely long and difficult, of which there will be 2 by the way, and final will be toughest of all. AVOID, Tsao isnt a great lecturer, monotone reading off the slides, but this course is easily doable if you just learn the examples and do a little bit more than provided in class. Exam wise 95% of the material is not foreign, which is pretty good for an upper division CS course. Not the end of the world if you have to take him, he is an average prof., Lectures are boring and there are far too many assignments, where some repeat questions from other assignments. He seems like a nice guy, but as a professor he is at the bottom of the list if I ranked all CS profs Ive taken. If I could go back I would try to take CS147 with someone else., Strong accent, low volume - better to learn through internet/homework/quizzes. A little lenient if you ask nicely. HW: pass/fail, has extra code for auto-feedback. Quizzes: in-class access code, multiple attempts, due midnight. Midterm/final: harder in-class + easier take-home parts, 50/50 point split, most problems are like the homework., HW and quizzes after every class. You have to sit really close to him to understand him, but he does record all his classes. He makes a lot of mistakes in Quizzes and HW instructions.\n\nBut overall he is very caring, listens to students, and gives extensions if required. \n\nIts easy to score an A/A- as long as you do his HW and quizzes religiously., Dude is really hard to understand. Heavy accent, just mumbles to himself during lectures. Instructions often have spelling and grammar errors, HW Submission is really strict. If the timer is one minute over, you get a 0. Be ready to google everything yourself and be bored during class. HW assignments are easy though. Avoid taking, The course is very assignment heavy. There is almost a pop quiz due every day. His lectures are not that great, he forces students to attend by taking attendance in every class. Most of the time I cannot hear or understand what the professor is saying in class. Not recommended., Professor Tsao isnt a bad person, but he does make you question why he teaches at all. He inspires virtually no interest in the topics he teaches, and his lectures dont make much sense. DEFINITELY make sure to communicate with classmates; it will save you, your grade, and your life. Shame that an interesting subject like this is taught so poorly., His accent is very horrible that during his lecture, I cant understand some points of his lecture. The lecture is some kind of straightforward, but you must take your time to understand it clearly. And he always makes mistakes during his lectures and even in midterms and FINAL! However, he always gives the extra work to curve the classs grades., Absolute worst professor ever. Mumbles through lectures, HEAVY accent, has little to no concept of what he is teaching and assigns a pop quiz every lecture. There is also one large lab every week, sloppy mistakes on midterms, not a single person attended the last lecture of the semester lol. Do not take his class., His course is super easy and helpful. I will choose him again, Hi is a very good CS professor. I like his teaching style., Tsao was nice and very accommodating to his students. He extended deadlines and gave extra credit on exams that he knew would be challenging. Overall, solid choice for OS, but its still a difficult subject, so be prepared to do a lot of studying by yourself., His accent is a bit rough but he cares about students learning and passing. He teaches with a very hands on method and A LOT of work. Lectures are literally him running scripts and programming. 65% of your final/midterm is take-home which is great. The workload is very large but really helpful if you want to improve your programming., Doesnt know a thing about teaching or what hes teaching. Makes mistakes on quizzes, tests, etc. But the class is easily passable, as long as you do all the homework and discuss lectures with classmates. Wouldnt recommend him but if nobody is better at least youll pass. You will not learn through unless you self-learn it all., I cant speak for his other classes, but he does NOT know enough of Python to be teaching any Python class let alone ADVANCED Python. He literally has been confused about how to create getters and setters and how to clear dictionaries. What a joke and a waste of my time and money., Doesnt seem to care AT ALL about teaching... Just mutters through the course material. Makes a lot of mistakes throughout his lectures., Hard to understand his lectures. Very vague, but a generous professor who understands your perspective and willing to extend deadlines. Way too much homework in a week., Hes a horrible lecturer, slides and assignments are filled with typos/errors. For lectures he assumes you know everything and even then his explanations are garbage. Easily available outside of class and is actually great in a 1 on 1 environment. For learning, make sure you do office hours with him as much as you can otherwise you wont pass., Professor Tsao is the nicest professor whom I have ever met in SJSU. He does very well in these aspects: 1, Tsaos lectures are logical and particular. 2, He posted his lecture slide at least two day before the class. 3, We can ask him question in every day. No more than 24 hours, he fed back my question on email or discuss with me on Zoom., He is the nicest CS professor in SJSU. He is easily reachable and he will reply to your email very quickly. He gives lots of help with my studies and he is there to help you with your grades. All you need to do is participate and ask questions to help with your studies., First time teacher + Corona time -> confusing + chaotic class. He has no experience doing this. Class is very disorganized and behind. He never managed to cover all the materials. Solution keys for hw, lab, quiz are most of the time wrong, making students confused and lose points. Students complain so much that he provides more than necessary EC., Worst professor Ive ever had (not by choice) and its not even close. Lectures are a mess, fails to answer questions that students ask because he cant elaborate, 23 quizzes, 100pt homework due every week (even during midterms and finals), 2 MIPS projects, changes answer keys for hw/quizzes because WE had to correct his mistakes he made. BEWARE., Horrible professor. Took him for CS 146 and 147. I shouldve learned my lesson the first time around., Professor Tsao is the worst professor I have come across in San Jose State. I have no idea how he got a position in the department. Every lecture is him reading off slides and every HW assignment/quiz had mistakes on almost every question. Expect to learn nothing from him and to self-study everything. Dont make the same mistake I did!, Every single lecture is an unorganized mess of him trying to convey the broadest of concepts in broken english. He is not able to demonstrate his understanding of the subject matter clearly at all. I have no idea how he got into SJSU CS department. 2 semester projects, weekly HWs and pop quizzes, 3 exams. Every lecture feels unprepared with errors., The class got switched to online due to the COVID-19. This professor is new, and he sometimes make some careless mistakes in his lecture, PPT or HW. However, he really knows his stuff. He understands the concept and has solid knowledge of this area. Unfortunately, his English is not that fluent, so sometimes he cannot express in an attractive way., Incoherent lectures, no real order of teaching, just reads off slides, and makes mistakes while reading off slides. Doesnt teach you how to do anything, just expects you to know. Every homework and lab has countless mistakes that are fixed by students. Complete joke of a class. Only take this class if you already know how to do everything., This guy is ridiculous.., What a joke of a class. Cant understand a word he says and constantly goes in loops while lecturing. Tons of mistakes in HW and notes. Has a Lab+HW due every week, even during midterms. All his homework is copy and pasted from god knows where because non of it makes sense. Worst teacher+class Ive taken in SJSU by a mile., This guy cant transfer his knowledge to students and he is confused when he is lecturing. I dont know why SJSU computer department choose him for this important course."
Frank Butt,/professor/115849,2.7,28%,3.5,"Super boring, just reads off slides. Offers no guidance or sympathy. Honestly not sure what he offers as a lecturer/instructor. Questions on tests are worded weirdly, so you need to know what he meant, not what he wrote. Know full stack web dev. If you have little/no knowledge of any of the skills in HW 0, self learn fast or take this class later, Most of this class revolves around the group project. There are weekly scrum meetings where every group goes up and shows their progress. Knowing web dev before taking this class will be useful because you wont learn it from the lectures. The lectures/slides are only needed for the tests+quiz. He allows cheatsheets so make sure to fully utilize em, Only reads off of slides, doesnt teach, or add any insight at all. Extremely boring and unenthusiastic. No clear grading rubric. Gives you cheat sheets for his exams but his exam questions are so random its impossible to prepare/study for. Expects you to learn all the coding on your own for the semester-long group project., Grading feels subjective without a clear rubric. Youll lose a large amount of points for minute and almost pointless things. He only reads of slides, which is completely different than homework., Only reads off his slides, which makes the class very uninteresting., Seemed unprepared, and often read off slides without elaboration, lectures were impossible to pay attention to. Lack of enthusiasm and inability to answer coding questions. Unclear group assignment rubric and overly large group sizes (6+). Relied on Professor Kenwards videos for teaching homework content which was the only learning I did in class., Professor Butt is one of the most outstanding CS professors I have ever had the pleasure to enroll w/ in SJSU; I would recommend his courses but be prepared for the workload as it is not a solo effort. Furthermore, I would say his classes are all about group collaboration. If you plan on taking his courses, be prepared to stress out a lil., Everything about this class is not that great. Hes very harsh when grading quizzes, the lectures dont really do much for you, and the final is worth 40%! He does a small curve at the end, and the easiest part of the class is the HW, and thats difficult in of itself. If you do poorly on the HW, you will fail this class., His assignments are not hard to do but you will be doing lot of self-learning, specifically reading from the textbook. His lecture is dry and his slides are too condensed with information. His quizzes are a bit challenging so make sure you understand the concepts well. So if you can self-learn from the textbook then you will do fine in this class., Im sure hes a nice person, but he sucks as a professor. The slides he put up has way too much information, and sometimes he just straight up shares his screen and reads us the textbook. Both resources are so ancient, and just so hard to digest. Database management is interesting to me, and I really want to be educated, but this class man. REGRET, Taking this class with Prof. Butt, I can say that if you are serious about the class, learning, and material from the first day of lecture, then you should be able to do good, or else you will fail for sure. The final exam is worth 40% of the whole grade. It can make or break your final grade. One positive is that there is heavy curving if needed., i hate my life in this class i wish i could drop!, He just reads off slides and expects you to know everything. HW and exams were difficult., Homework and projects were very hard. Must know C/C++ to do the homework. Tests were heavy with some questions from the lecture. Hell offer some top students in the class internships at IBM so you can accelerate your career if you do well., He warns everyone at the start of the semester, but he was the only one teaching for this class. - dry lectures, he just reads off the textbook - slow at grading - project is long and difficult - 2 quizzes and a final thats worth 40% - MUST know c/c++ pros -I went out of characters, so I cannot write any., keep reading from the textbook for the whole semester, worse instructor even seen, His teaching style of only reading off the textbook is very helpful since I cannot read the textbook myself. Exams, homeworks and projects are very very difficult. Do yourself a favour and never take this guy. Your welcome. Also doesnt record lecture/allow you to record because you can learn more by (?), This was the worst professor I have met in SJSU. He is too lazy. No preparation for class. No slides. No lab instructions. He only read books and didnt provide any practical examples. The quiz and homework were difficult. I only can learn by myself. So sad. Dont take his class!, If you pay attention to lectures and do decent on the project, you should pass with a B. His tests are worded really oddly which throws you off. He writes the tests himself and theyre about small things he mentions during lecture, not really from the powerpoints. Cheat sheets allowed during exam., Horrible prof. Lectures are boring/useless and I never understood what was going on so I stopped going to class. No prep for quizzes which are full of obscure true/false Qs. Lazy attitude and ignores Qs from students he doesnt want to answer. HW seems confusing at first but youll get used to it soon. Only good thing is he extended HW due dates., He just stole lecture slides from this other professor that wrote the textbook. Its so obvious that he just wings his lectures and rambles off of the slides. The only reason people were able to pass his class was because they watched the recorded lectures from the original professor and because he curved the grades by 10% cuz the avgs were so low., For his CS 160 class, hes alright. Make sure you contribute to your 10 week long project really well. Its a great opportunity to learn new tech stack. As for his midterm and final, he lets you have cheat sheets. So make sure to update your cheat sheets each week. If you do those steps, you will most likely get an A., I attended every single lecture. Zoom course, doesnt show face cam. Reads off slides while stuttering and mumbling. Doesnt draw examples, uses Zoom chat to show examples. Doesnt give study material for quizzes or quiz answers once over, tells you to re-watch Zoom recording to figure it out. Forced to figure out asm lang by myself. Scoffs at you., This professor is absolutely horrible. came to class without preparation at all! read off the slides, do no know how to explain, get more confused after asking questions. I had to watch the CMU video lecture to study, and it is way much better! 100% self study, I could describe him with an essay! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I learned more by sleeping than I ever did in lectures. Ignores and talks over questions he doesnt want to answer Assignments are deplorable. No instructions, helps, teaching at all. 40% final. > 60% of your grade is from obscure T/F questions No real teaching. Throwing concepts around, He\s okay. Takes pride in how difficult his other classes are but this class, being a project course, is mostly based on the people you get in your group. He has a pretty good system to form groups with balanced skill sets. You are assigned a project in this course so if you had a specific senior project in mind, it\s not for you., He teaches obsolete information and stuff that do not matter. He mark you down for not answering the wrong answer that he said in class. (If you check the quiz on google you will realize that his answers are wrong) He disabled discussions and comments on canvas to not get any criticism. He is too lazy to change the HW and still uses one from 2008., Professor Butts class is not an easy A class, but you get to learn the some good stuff from him. There are about 5 coding assignments. If you are a hard worker, he is there to answer to your questions through emails and during office hour. Be prepared to put in right amount of effort if you want to do well., Hes overall a pretty chill and easy prof. The whole class is a project and two tests. He allows multiple sheets to refer to during the tests. The project is alright. As long as you get down the basic requirements needed for the project and do alright in your tests you should expect a high grade in his class. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND, Responsive to my many emails, questions during class. Projects is great at helping you learn code. Must come to office hours bc that is where he explains the project in detail. Assembly is hard but once you go the hang of it (reading the textbook helps!!!) its fun. Some ppl even said they like assembly during office hr. Great class!, You get what you put in. If you go to office hr, he spends time there explaining projects in detail. Very clear after going to them. It takes effort for him to be sitting at 9pm doing office hrs. Coding must be studied alongside lectures. Read textbook (especially ch3 and understand the code)! I was lost, but after reading that, I caught up., Cs47 is so much content, its hard to cover only in lecture. Students must read textbook in addition to lec to understand. Prof Butta lec give you a head start in reading. His projects after you do them correctly makes you pro at assembly. Testing is very fair. Reads emails. This is what is expected of a good professor. Thank Professor Butt!, Professor Butt is the worst professor that Ive had at SJSU so far. His homework problems come with little to no instructions. His lectures are so nondescriptive and he gives a more confusing answer to your question when you ask. He seems as if he has no idea what he is teaching. Ive never been so lost in a class. He really shouldnt be teaching., Prof Butt is great! Must read textbook, but Prof Butt uses lecture to go through what you should be reading. It makes reading much easier! Doesnt read from slides, but explains it. Stays lively throughout whole lecture. Grading very clear, tests what he teaches, extremely fair. Puts in time outside of class to answer emails and office hr. Awesome!, Prof Butt is fair, tests only what he covers, grading system is reasonable, some projects. Must read the textbook to fully understand lecture and how to code. If u read,this class is reasonable and fair. Prof Butt is clear on what he tests and on project requirements. Course is very useful!covers assembly behind C and comp basics. Study C! Take him, This was a project based class. Pray you dont have slackers on your team since it is random., The guy cant teach. He reads off those textbook slides. He has his full time job at IBM and dont care about students. There is a group project which is expected for this class, but no direction or mentorship. He does not take attendance, but it is mandatory otherwise you lose points on the scrum meetings. Avoid, His lectures are boring and not interesting. He does not put any effort into his class. Very laid back. Occasionally late or let students out early.... not a good professor., Attendance is kind of mandatory for scrum meetings, but outside of that, not really. He does take attendance in all his classes though. He definitely puts more effort in to his upper division classes over his lower division classes. Fairly laid back for 160, let classes out early to watch warrior games, Material was vague and based on textbook. To be honest, I didnt learn anything new or practical. Both projects and the midterm are tough, but the final is relatively easy. Fortunately, at the end he put a big curve that is bigger than the curve on the EARTH LOL. That makes up for the toughness., Wouldnt take it again with him even for a million dollars. Taught abs nothing whole semester. If you didnt do nothing in the projects, you learned nothing in the class. No ppts, no lectures. Gives assignment teaches nothing on how to do it. Self taught class, no need to come to class. wasnt ready for class. lots of hws expect work., Always come to class unprepared and brag about his job at IBM. His lecture is pointless, only about his life stories nobody cares. Yeah we get it you work for IBM, so what? Doesn\t automatically qualify you become a good professor. Please resign from SJSU and stop ruining our future. No wonder IBM is going downhill with a senior manager like him, Excellent teacher with extensive industry experience. The CS47 class will learn a lot of assembly code and learning a lot about bits and bytes, memory representation, hierarchy, etc. His lecture can be a little unorganized especially when he writes on the board (not necessarily left to right). Tests are tricky but he lets you use notes and book., Professor Butts teaches practical programming skills.    His assignments are meaningful, the time I spent working on them paid off at my work. I impressed my boss by  code optimization. Lectures are informative  grading is fair. I hope to take another his class before graduation in 2016., Materials discussed in class will be tested in midterms and final. Programming assignments are time consuming, make sure ask him questions about them before it is too late. Lecture is fast and confusing. Cover less materials than the other course. We wasted 2 class time to watch a movie and discuss it. Not irrelevant. Textbook is lightly used., It was good chance to learn real tool for IBM. Class was not hard programming project as easy and Grading was fair., Cool prof, but labs are really hard and time consuming. Hws are based on power point slides. Though the project is really interesting; you need to start on it right away. I also liked his motivational personal stories. Fair grader., good lecturer. info is presented clearly and succinctly. tests arent easy, but mostly fair aside from a little bit of trickiness. subject info from lectures is what youre tested on(no surprises). he curves. funny., What I heard about him is not true. In fact, this semester he wants to pass everyone, even better gives good grades. Believe it or not, easy A+. HW1 is kind of tricky; HW2 is super easy. 2 Mids are not very hard, but final is almost identical to mids. Project is heavy and hard, but to me it is the best one at cs dept. Highly Recommend!, I do recommend you to take his class. Very clear presentation; very knowledgeable and useful course., Very challenging projects. Easy HWs but Tricky exams. Calm going, very pleasant, never saw him bad tempered. Quite approachable. Can make the class a little interactive and interesting., I do recommend you to take Butts class if you need a grade: labs are the hardest things during the semester assigned and graded by his grader. You will have 3 quizzes (midterms but he calls them quizzes)and the final(40%). You will not know your grade anytime during the semester until you they are posted in mysjsu.Surprise grader, ended up with B., His exams are meant to be tricky tricky. This guy will read straight from the book every lecture. His lecture is boring - no lecture plan, no slide, no prep at all. Got -A from reading the book and learned myself. Terrible teacher., Unprepared Lectures:  He stares at the book for two minutes, writes something on the board, says 10 words or less and stares at the book for two minutes again.  First quiz was open book / open notes with 10 questions (7 Mult. Choice) and it still took the fastest person 1.5 hours to finish.  Book is worthless.  HW and Final were OK.  Enjoy!, Excellent and challenging projects.  Final exam is tough but grades are curve.  Heavy workload thoughout the semester.  Weak students usually drop out early so you are competing with good students all semester., If you can not write well in C/C++, dont take his class. His projects make you craze and sleepless, but he lets most students pass his class, He cant teach. He simply reads off those textbook slides. And the reason his midterm and quizzes are difficult is because they consist of mainly true/false questions. Makes teaching look easy. The only challenging part of his course was his projects., Make sure no have no more than 12 units or you will be in trouble. Will make you work but will learn a lot., Lots of experience makes him very knowledgeable and his class was very rewarding"
Robert Chun,/professor/216637,4.2,60%,3,"This class is easy, as long as you go to class and study, easy A., This class is phenomenal. Take this class and you wont regret it!, Horrible behavior by this professor who grades people who behave flirtatiously and are intrusive, hardworking people who diligently work are not recognised, but people who do over action and sycophantic or someone whose outward personality he likes, gets high marks even though they put low efforts, its highly condemnable in academic circles, Good professor and a clear communicator. Two exams, averages this year were 82 and 80, if I recall correctly. Final exam is just writing about 6 student presentations at the end of the semester. He tells you to study for six papers but tests you on the three you know the best.\n\nNo attendance required, first 8 weeks are all prerecorded lectures., Worst professor at San Jose state! Purposefully keeps the lectures online even though the campus is fully open. Not much was learned through the course and the worst grading criteria for all the assignments and exams., Great lecturer and the best option for CS147. If you attend his lectures and do the few homework problems he gives it will be enough for the tests., Professor doesnt put effort in creating new homework, midterm or final questions. He has been using the same slides, midterm questions since 2013. So it is an easy course if someone asks around. The course needs to be updated with 2022 level syllabus rather than 2013.\nAlso, the grad course and the undergrad course uses the same material LOL., I loved the structure of Chuns Parallel Processing class. The first half of the semester we go over basic parallel processing (also a rehash of CS 147/149). The second half is only student presentations on a plethora of topics. Basically every student can do a presentation on anything related to PP. The final was just writing about 3 presentations, Pros: Organized and amazing lectures, clear and soothing voice, one has to follow his lecture sheets for the midterms. Replies to e-mails. Cons: Very tough grader. No extra credit option., Hes very experienced in his subject of computer architecture. The course itself requires lots of reading and Dr Chun tries his best to cover it all in his lectures. His quizzes are not easy. I thought he was very organised with his lecture slides and presentations., Professor is good. No weekly assignments. Two project assignments throughout the course and a midterm exam and final exam. Overall course structure is easy., Very organized, clear lectures. Notes are exhaustive and the two assignments are easy., Good teacher. Easy grades., Great Professor! Every lecture was very clear and easily comprehensible.  He summarizes his previous lecture before he starts class . The questions in the 2 Assignments for the semester can be answered if we understand his lectures., TERRIBLE AVOID him by all means. He never answers his email and he is so mean if luckily he answers. His exams is so long and not easy to answer all questions in a limited period of time.Students who can answer have sample exams from before.Even he is not a good grader. I got different score from your classmate from the identical answers!!!!!, He is one of the most organized professors on the campus,cristal clear lectures along with easy projects. For midterms and final, make sure you memorize everything from his notes. He has such soothing voice, which will make you go to sleep the first couple of weeks, but you will get used to it., I like him, the first few weeks seemed slow, but as we progressed i started enjoying the material. Professor Chun really knows the material, dont even bother buying the book. The entire class is based on his lecture notes (cant stress enough). Make sure you cover everything from his lecture notes for the midterm. Get a head on the projects., Chun is THE best professor! His lectures are extra clear. He has this calm zen surrounding him. He always smiles his signature smile. He cares about his students. Show up to class everyday and ask him questions if youre stuck. Youll enjoy his class. This guy knows what hes talking about. His exam is long and challenging., Excellent professor.  His lectures are very clear, and he really cares that students are learning and understand the material.  His test are really long, but if you go to class everyday and do the projects youll be fine., The best professor in CS department. Go for the FPGA project option (and not paper) and you will never regret it in terms of experience, knowledge and grade!! Have his previous exams if possible. Very nice person!!, Pros:He is by far the most organized professor and conducts the class in professional manner.Very patient and helpful.The presentations required by the students help in learning new topics. Cons: The lectures tend to be little bit on the boring side but if we follow the lectures then there wont be any surprises on the midterms or the finals., He only taught for the last few weeks of my class in place of Teoh, but he is good.  Chun is an old style teacher, even his handouts look like theyve been typed up on a type-writer.  Hes clear, easy to understand, and easy to learn from.  Do the homework, and you should be fine.  Lectures are a bit on the boring side, though., Only advise- have his old tests. He follows the patterns.Tests are very long and conceptual, but if u know the patterns from the old tests then only, u can finish it and try some of the new materials. Final was like a book. But chun is a very good teacher. Pay attention to his every word., Professor chun is very clear on his lectures.I love his teaching style, But I have one advise for the students , dont take any make up exam. He will make your life miserable with the make up exam.Do the exam on time.He will give 1 1/2 equal weight of actual exam ., Dr. Chun has very clear notes and detailed explanation about the topics he covers in class. Noone can teach as clear and fun as him in the CS dept. He makes the most difficult subject as easy as possible. When you go to his office hour, he will help you with all his heart., One of the best professors. His teaching is very clear and helpful. Makes the subject very interesting. It was always fun to be in this class and learn the subject., He is very helpfull and understanding. One of the most organized professors in CS Dept. I love him!!, One of the best teachers in the CS department, if not the best one. He has a course reader that is pretty much your class notes, so you get everything on paper and all you have to do is listen to him. His lectures are very clear too. His exams are hard because they are long, but if you did the homework it should be doable., Good professor. Lectures are very clear and concise. Hardly used the book at all, material either from lecture or from course reader. He grades based on understanding of concepts rather than memorization, lots of partial credit from this.  Tests are long but definitely doable. Highly recommended., only complaint is that the tests are too long to finish, easy to make mistake on those algorithms where if you mess up somewhere in the middle, the whole thing/ answer is wrong. Even if you know how to do it, the pressure to finish in time and not look at it twice could cost you. Thats the only thing I did not like, he is a very good teacher., If you need someone to hold your hand through concepts, Chun is your guy.  His lectures are very well done... he breaks things down to very basic levels.  If youre smart, this can be boring at times, as he explains in depth something that is pretty easy to grasp. His tests are long, and he has a tendency to throw some things that you dont expect., Extremely clear, thorough, and helpful, Dr. Chun is extremely well-prepared every lecture (he uses largely the same course handout every semester).  Some of the verbage (line printers?  tape drives?) is a bit archaic, but the concepts are solid.  Tests are very long and wordy, but not too tough if youve kept up.  Best prof Ive had at SJSU so far., Chun is a excellent lecturer. Takes the time to explain concepts in good detail. His first project is VERY long, the second is half of the first one, and the last one is thrown in the mix right before finals (1/5 size of first), but all are the same weight. Exams are REALLY REALLY long and can be tricky, study notes. Graded harshly (little partial), He rocks... Chun teaches extremely well. Compared to Dr. Lee he is like a breath of fresh air to learn from. Very clear, knowledgable and intelligent. I have learned a lot about operating systems in this class., poor teaching, poor grading. pretentious. course graded by the curve, which does benefit all if you put in the necessary effort., Very clear lecturer. Although topics seem complex, breaks them down and takes time @ beginning of each lecture to review material from previous. Tests are really long but not too hard if you study; they do require some memorization. Grader for this class was really bad, though. You wont need to buy the text, since everythings in his $6 notes., Took his class in 04. I am soon to graduate now, and I must say, this was the worst prof ever. All the other CS staff is outstanding, even the latest additions are extremely bright., Great teacher. Great person. Tough class but he prepares you if you study and do the hw., Organized lectures, very knowledgable, but can be quite boring sometimes. Tests are very long, but not too hard if you review and grasps all the concepts from his lecture notes. Overall, very effective teacher. I would take this teacher again for another class., Probably the best CS professor in this department, Dr. Chun is a very knowledgable and helpful professor.  You do not need to take very many notes because they are provided to you.  His tests are very difficult.  His final is practically impossible; if it wasnt on the midterms, it will be on the final!, THE best professor in the Computer Science Department...Tests are difficult but they test wheather you really know the subject...Extermely helpful and speaks very clearly...Extreme patience, Hes better than the average professor, but his lectures can get quite boring.  His exams are quite tough as well.  Try answering the questions in an outline form (not complete sentences) or else you wont have enough time to finish., very professional. One of the best professors in CS department, Great teacher! Very professional! Tests are killer but graded easily., His presentation is all slides. Every slide he uses is in his workbook or is passed out.  The trick to doing well in his class is to take rigorous notes even though he practically reads from the slides.  Very boring lectures and very boring style., Extremely polished and preofessional presentations.I learned a lot., He has to be the best CS teacher there is in this department. He gives a clear presentation, which helps one learn the material. And his exams are difficult and long!!!"
Jeff Smith,/professor/94606,2.5,N/A,3.5,"Avoid at all costs save your time take another professor., Extremely dry and boring lectures that are not easy to follow, even when youre interested in the subject. Tests and homework were not bad, and he grades very fast. But I think he only gave one A in the whole class. Lowest grade Ive received in any CS class ever (of 20 taken) despite considerable effort. Avoid., Not particularly interesting, entire class pretty much zones out on laptops / phones while he teaches in a fairly mundane matter...then he shoots up about 3 octaves to get your attention. Definitely not an exciting teacher nor very helpful. Mostly vague in everything, but not the hardest / worst Ive seen, Some people see classes as places with students against the teacher. Thats how this teacher seems to see it. He really needs to let it go. There may be something about his lectures that could use some work.. but all I can focus on is how I get to sit in his class and see him slam his stick to get peoples attention, comfy with this state of things, kind effective teacher; covered subject matter well (most of the time); no trauma, no drama, reasonable tests, reasonable homework, reasonable grading; does all grading himself so he can gauge how everyones doing; very smart guy - one of the best in the dept; should change the text tho.  He was happier than we were that the class ended - funny, Hes alright. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. His assignments are easy. His instructions are unnecessarily convoluted and complex. His exams are from the material that he explicitly covered in class. His lectures are boring. He wants to make sure you understand the topics though. Helpful during question time. Somewhat socially awkward.., basically its a very hard class. the subject matter can be very difficult but he teaches it well. Hes willing to help explain further concepts. A lot of hw but its extremely helpful when it comes to exams. (time consuming but worth it!) Exams can be hard but if u pay attention in class and understand the hw u should be okay., This is not a easy class, but if you are willing to learn, you will learn quite a lot from his class. His lectures are so clear and detailed and he is very helpful and pertty fair in grading., The most demotivating professor I have ever come across. He tries to be hard on students in every way possible. Not a good study experience. Try to avoid him but since he teaches this course most of the time it might be hard to do so. So, GOODLUCK!! :), Thorough organized clear lectures.  Very good notes.  Very fair open book tests. Prompt return of homework assignments and tests. Prompt email responses. Reads every line of programming assignments and provides helpful comments. Very fair grading.  I dont expect to be entertained by an instructor, I expect to be taught - and he does this very well, Prof. Smith is extremely helpful during his office hours and more than willing to spend however much time is needed to answer your questions. The book is heavily used, and it is strongly suggested to read it thoroughly. Open-book/note tests force you to have a very clear understanding of the material., Hes very book oriented. If youve read the book before the exams, youll do fine because anything he puts on the test, you can use the book. Harsh grader on the programs though., This is teacher is so unclear. His lectures are boring, his words didnt make any sense. Cant explain clearly what he wants on the assignments. Harsh grader, strict as hell. Exams are open book and open notes but his Exams will go beyond these the material. Suggestion: Dont take his class no matter what, try to find some other teachers if possible., Hes so pedantic, so clear, and so precise during his lectures; it becomes quite hard to stay awake. On the contrary, if youre able to stay awake, and are willing to learn, youll probably learn quite a lot. Attendance is not required, but highly recommended. Tests can be challenging. Recommended., DO NOT TAKE HIM! He does not explained the subjects clear, and he went beyond the book. Almost one and half chapter per week, lots of reading and homework. Open book and open notes for the midterms and final, but its hard. Hes not helpful during the office hour, he cant tell where I made the mistakes on the hw. Take someone else if you can!!, No curve. Open book midterms and final. You need to do all the hw to do good in the class. Lectures arent too clear. You have to read most of the book to do well. His slides has some good points, but are not great at all. He tells jokes, but arent funny., Smith is my favorite professor Ive had at SJSU.  Hes an extremely smart guy, and his I always found his lectures to be clear and helpful.  Im convinced that thinking his lectures are boring is a symptom of not paying close enough attention., Exams and assignments are very unclear, lectures are boring and unorganized. Requires a lot of reading by yourself if you wanna pass the class. Do not take him unless you are familiar with the course material., His lectures are torture - very long, dry, and unorganized. His exams and programs can be tricky, only because he chooses to communicate in an unclear uncommited manner. As a result of taking this class, I feel that I can pick up any new language and start writing programs within a few days., Lectures tend to be longwinded and not very well-organized. He doesnt seem to fully appreciate the steep learning curve in functional and logic programming (problem with the course itself, actually). Strongly recommend taking CS154 before doing 152. The book (Loudens) is awful. Be prepared to consult outside sources to fully learn the material., Exams are mostly from what he teaches in the class.Homework and test grading is tough,you will lose lot of points for small mistakes,but the tests are easy.Does not curve much.Textbook for this class(Hopcroft)is useless so need to do lot of searching over the internet to get reasonable explanation., Boring lecturer. His test are easy. tests are open book and he gives a lot of partial credit., not clear, hard to understand, tests not to hard,, boring, difficult to understand, does not like to accommidate students needs, Not clear in lectures, but very organized. Follow the assignments and his tests guidelines, you will learn a lot. His materials are no ****. Also keeps the archive of his past tests: very helpful. Responds through mail very promptly., This guy is a cs students nightmare. His assignments are vague and easily misunderstood despite being pedantically worded, hes a tough grader, and somebody really needs to tell him to stop speaking geek. The best advice I can give is: DONT TAKE HIM!, Very hard on grading programs. Even though you get it right he still will take 15% off as miscelaneous deductions. Tests are easy. Homeworks assignments are worth 50% of the grade. Will not ever take him again. Text book is one of the worst I, Bad professor, not clear, Will not take class with him again. Unfair in grading, hard to understand. Cannot stand for himself., OK overall. Programs are graded hard, and hes not clear in his directions. Tests are graded easy, and doable, even though you will not really know what he will test on. The Weiss text will really not help you, so dont miss the class., cant understand what he is talking about. I tot i was alone but found out that others are experiencing the same thing. the subject was pretty fun but his lecture was awful. i could sit for 1hr15mins and was totally lost all the time.hard grader!!!, This instructor seems to have a very low self-confidence, and compensates for that through authoritarian rule. He is rude, condescending, and not helpful. When asked a question about grading, his stock answer is I don\t know. Avoid this profes, His assignments are very vague.  You dont know what he really wants!  His grading is very picky and his exams are abstract.  Hes not very helpful and hes very unclear.  Also, his leactures are VERY BORING., Challenging assignments, not difficult if you are comfortable with prerequisite material.  Pay attention to guidelines for documentation.  Tests are comprised of examples and material presented in class., never ever take any CS course with this clown. his teaching is a joke. well, not really. none of us were laughing when he failed us, Hard teacher.  Class was boring.  Assignments were confusing.  Tests were ok, but only because they were open book., Lousy commnunicator.  Even defensive.  His assigmemnt descriptions are very odd.  Most students had difficutlies in decyphering what the hell he wanted.  If you dont know java already, the DONT take this guy., Didnt seem too interested in helping, assignments can be kind of hard. He isnt clear on his assignments, and sometimes ran into problems because of mistakes he made., His lecture is very boring.  Very strict on grading.  If you are the one who can study through self-study, it may be ok to take his class.  Otherwise, do not take it., A little too easy, but I learned a lot from programs., programs were really hard and i was lost the whole semester. tests were ok tho cuz they were open book. i failed the class cuz the programs are worth more., Programs are pretty difficult and hes very strict on grading. Exams are easier, and they are also open book., Hard programs, easy test. each 50% of grade.. CS coordinator - good, Very good. Knows his stuff."
Mark Stamp,/professor/281383,4.4,88%,2.7,"Speaks soft/quiet so its difficult to hear in larger classes. Sometimes better to just watch the recordings for clearer speech. Otherwise good lectures, since he wrote the textbook. Lots of difficult hw, often with little explanation from graders (also inconsistent). Tests are much easier (and graded easier) than hw and follow the review closely., Great professor, gives weekly/almost weekly homework that the tests are based on. Willing to work with students in office hours or online in the forums. Exams are paper, no notes/cheat sheets and are 75% of the grade, but you can be prepared with just homework and slides. If you attend class and do homework, hard not to get a B., He is one of the best teachers Ive seen at this school: great lectures, and clear grading criteria. The homework assignments are lengthy, but as long as one starts them on time and puts in the effort, its doable. Dont be put off by the difficulty - if you want to learn machine learning properly, this is a must-take course., Weekly HWs (just right combination of mathematical proofs and hands-on coding implementation for the ML algorithms), frequent pop-up quizzes (really helpful to go deep at least once with nitty-gritty of numerical solving by hands), term project (proposal and presentation) and a group final (real highlight of CS271, collaborative and competitive)!, Great lectures, but gives homework every week. Grading is fair with lots of emphasis placed on the weekly assignments and the course projects., Amazing Professor. Took both his classes. Explains very well and has a lot of experience in the security field. Weekly assignments., If you are interested in Information security, this class would be really helpful.  Good: Prof. Stamp explains concepts really well. His book is really well written.  Tough: He talks slow. Homeworks and projects are demanding.  Overall, really good experience., He speaks really slow and takes forever to get to the point.  It bores the class so nobody rarely participates.  Hes ok to just call on the same males in the class., One of the amazing professor SJSU CS dept has. His classes will never be boring. Started loving security after this class. Projects will be very interesting. Every week will be having homeworks.  Midterms and final will be easy if you do your homeworks properly., Very good professor. Weekly homework of reasonable difficulty, which he goes over when its due. He wrote the textbook and knows his stuff., Organized and clear lectures., Cool Professor. Lecture is very clear and projects are reasonable. Grading is fair. This class might help you job interview., Great Professor and a humble divine soul. Took Ad. Software Security class with him. Loved the way he teaches and his genuine interest in his students success. I also ended up doing my thesis under him. Always eager to help his students., Mark Stamp is an asset to this department. He is one of the best teachers at SJSU. The text we used was his own. The book and his lecture notes are extremely clear. You dont need to come to class, but I highly recommend it. The homework questions are hard, but the tests are easy compared to that, so hope you get an easy grader., One of the best professors. Makes the class extremely simple and fun. Teaches from scratch. Fair with grading, This was software reverse engineering. First semester for this course. Mark has a great passion for the subject and this comes across. Assignments and final are extremely challenging but if you are prepared to work hard you will learn a lot. Lectures are always interesting and he values input from his students. Highly recommended., Excellent professor and person!! Do the homework regularly and the exams will be easy!, As every student says, he is awesome. His material is very concise. Attend the class and do homework. Answer questions in class and would not be shameful if he does not know answer. His class is highly recommended., THIS IS THE BEST CLASS EVER!!! :D :D :D :D, Excellent Prof.. learned a lot in his course, Awesome prof! Ive had him before for Java and still has the same humor which makes class enjoyable. Every lecture is packed with info and slides provided online help supplement them.  Exams arent too challenging, just study well and do the homework, youll do fine., Although he doesnt know much java, he is a very good professor and I would highly recommend him for any CS class. He focuses more on the data structures and leaves figuring out the code to you., What a course!! Amazing Prof and excellent course. He knows every nook and corner of the subject and has complete command on what he is speaking. Funny, friendly, suggests as per necessity, responds promptly to mails. A student cant ask for anything more! Do not miss out his course! Impressive., A Cool and fun teacher. 10 homework assignments, 2 midterms, and 1 final. they all determine the grade. Office hours are very helpful., CS 161 is elective, but it should be required for anybody who wants to code in real world! This is the most practical, interesting, challenging and plain useful class Ive taken. You can take the knowledge and use it at your job for YEARs to come. Mark Stamp is very good lecturer!, This is one of the best professor I ever seen in my life. Excellence !!!!, very nice professor. If you work on the assignments regularly you can get good grades, Ok teacher, witty humor.  Tests are based on homework and lectures, pretty easy.  First time teaching Java, he did alright., One of the best instructors at SJSU. Extremely organized, clear and helpful. However, the first 2 midterms and all 9 homeworks were challenging. Final exam was not cumulative and relatively easier than the previous material. Great class, great teacher... youll learn a lot!, Information Security class was the most useful elective Ive taken. There was so much material covered, that it was a bit overwhelming. I would hope this class eventually can be split in A and B section so we can do a bit more coding. Im already in the industry and this is by far the most relevant class to real live., I had one of my most memorable classes with Dr. Stamp.  He is very knowledgable, fair, and prompt.  If the departement could offer other courses with him, it would have had great achievements for university and the students., That class was really awesome. The only fault is that the class tries to condence an awful lot of material into 15 weeks. But Dr. Stamp does an excellent job of hitting all the important points. If you have a chance, TAKE THIS CLASS!, The worst professor I have ever taken a class.He does not give the answers of the homework. No review for final and he gives a very hard final. No idea what kind of final we are getting . Tough grader, The curriculum taught in CS158B is not at all helpful in the industry.  Unfortunately Professor Stamp has to teach it and it makes the class very dull.  He is an overall nice guy, but I felt like I wasted an entire semester on useless information.  Overall easy teacher, but if you want to learn something useful for your career I suggest Melody Moh., Easy class if you study. Pay special attention to his lecture. Things he repeats many times are homework or exam questions. His industry experience keeps the content of this class fresh. A good practical class to take., Great class. Good professor with alot of experience and willingness to teach. Takes most of the details and mathmatics out and presents the main ideas. Very straightforward exams, although some homework problems are hard. Stamp will usually answer your emails within 15 min of sending them., Enjoyed the class very much. Professor likes the subject a lot and its much better than most CS classes. Professor is open and responsive to questions in class and doesnt mind people making a few jokes, too. But be aware of the slow asian kids in the back who ask stupid questions., Taking the same class at the previous poster, expect to find lonely nerds in the class, and they will ask some dumb a** questions and sometimes answer YOUR questions. Overall easy grader, do your HW and youll be fine. The white dude who sits in the front sucks., Good class, but theres this one annoying white dude who sits in the front of the class who wont shut the F*CK UP -- otherwise all 5s, Horrible prof. doesnt care about the students future. Expects us to have his level of knowledge. Grading is strict. gives a lot of homeworks .Keeps the semester busy., Very, very knowledgable. He worked for the NSA for 13 years.\n nuff said., lectures are clear & well organized. if you dont study regularly his weekly quizes can pull your grade down. he likes to ask questions about networking stuff details so you have to have good memory. easy grader. lots of partial credits :), His lectures are clear and tries his best to make you understand. Unfortunately, he is not up-to-date with current networking technology, since he is a security expert--worked at NSA. Plus his exams test you on how much youve memorize."
Benjamin Reed,/professor/2426648,3.8,68%,4.1,"Here is my advice for taking his class: \n\nDONT., Ben is a great prof and you can feel his enthusiasm during lectures. Homework isnt bad but is graded on accuracy and not completion so you definitely cant afford to procrastinate (I did and my grade suffered lol). Exams were straightforward and a lot easier than the homework and will easily carry your grade. Overall the class was very rewarding., Ben is a good professor but his class is not for slackers. His assignments are quite difficult and will take a lot of your time throughout the semester. But if you do have the time and interest to put in a lot of work, you will get a lot out of his class. Personally, I found his class to have a steep learning curve but I dont regret taking him., I find Ben very inspiring and easy to understand. He starts his class with questions and uses iClicker to practice. Hes available outside class, and his office hours are easy to attend.\nThis platform is for rating my professor, so my review is solely for the professor, not OS as a course. The OS class itself is a headache., Professor Reed isnt a bad professor, but the way the operating systems course was taught for CMPE felt overwhelming. The assignments felt like they were unbelievably hard, and at times would feel like it was impossible to complete them at the pace that they were given, which felt like there was no breathing room. The autograder wrecked the grades., As an upper-division class, preparation & independence are expected. Some students may find that they need to catch up others find the class easy. I give code examples for assignments and start off class with time for questions about the assignments. Few students took advantage of it. Preparation & independence prepare students for career success., For CS158A. Prof. Reed is my favorite professor at SJSU. Decent lecturer but his slides arent very clear; however, if you go to his office hours for help he will write you a book of everything you need to know. Extremely friendly and willing to help. No curve balls on exams but the final was pretty tough. Sad to see him go to the CMPE department., Ben is one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subjects, and he shows through his actions that he cares about his students and likes his job.\n\nTests are very straightforward and fair. Homework assignments are difficult, but that is due to the content of the class being difficult., OS lives up to its notoriety as being one of the most challenging courses that CS students may take. I had a study group, went to office hours, read the book, took notes during class, and turned in labs early. Reed is on your side, but you have to put in the work to get the grade you want. Go to his office hours, he is on your team., Make sure to treat the assignments like projects because they basically are! Great guy: knowledgable, accessible, and helpful., I like the enthusiasm he has for the class. Very knowledgeable. I think that the way he explains things are clear and easy to understand most of the time. I think some of the 6 programming assignments are a bit too lengthy and could be overwhelming at times (although he does give you a lot of time), Hes a caring professor and a nice person overall, however the class is is incredibly difficult and time consuming. Although he says, knowing C is not required, you will have to be extremely comfortable with C to do well on his homework assignments. Just going to lecture wont help; read all the txtbook chapters he assigns and self learn., Nice guy but he deos not care about students who genuinely bring up issues to him for consideration., This class was a little difficult but if you care enough to try it is not impossible to get a good grade. The hardest part about the class was the individual assembly assignments, however, you can ask questions and he will help you understand how to get the solution. All of the exams had very clear study guides that made studying easier!, OS is one of the hardest and a core class in the CS major, although I dropped the class due to my own problems. Ben is one of the great professors I ever had at SJSU. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate to teach his students. The difficulty of the subject is the reality of the CS Major that you have to learn it and go through it., This is the first time that Prof. Reed has taught this class, and so far he has done a poor job. He gives out assembly language coding assignments while barely teaching us assembly language in the lectures; instead, he mostly focuses on concepts being covered in the textbook. I wish that he would cover the specific content of the assignments more., i barely teach assembly. its not an assembly class. we cover a super small subset for the projects. there not too much to say about MOV, ADD, SUB, JNZ, and JMP, the main ops for the projects, but i did spend multiple lectures on them. the difficulty comes from applying the concepts you learn to the projects. thus, i focus on the concepts., Difficult content, and the expectations for this class are very high. To succeed, youll need to read the textbook , spend a lot of time on homework assignments (that are mini projects by themselves), and ask a lot of questions. Falling behind results in snowballing. If youre willing to put in the effort, youll learn a ton in this class., He is always eager to teach, but because this course is really dense, it is hard to cover everything. If you have trouble understanding something, ask and he will explain in more detail. The coding assignments are heavy projects and require a lot of time. Tests are based off ungraded homework questions, so try to pay attention to those. Nice guy., You will learn a lot, the class is difficult, but if you ask, he WILL help you. Project is great, you apply EVERYTHING you learn. Office hours are extremely helpful. He gives you exactly what you need to study for tests. In my 4 years of college, this was my favourite class. Ben is approachable and caring if you show you care about the class., The class teaches you to drive remote-controlled cars, and homework asked you to drive Transformers. He just only read textbooks and just only used #C. every assignment is not he did grade., wow! that sounds like a cool class! unfortunately, we don\t do remote-controlled cars. transformers would be even more awesome. we also use C not C# for the projects. we do have a grader that grades the programming assignments. the ungraded homework is a study guide for the exams and is not graded (it\s in the name ;) )., Best cs professor at sjsu! you will use what you learn from him in industry. Ben is very informational and will help you understand everything, he really goes above and beyond for students. Assignments can be hard but if you want to learn they are fun, I agree with the people who say hes a nice guy. But he also has no consideration for whether or not his students can complete his assignments. I even went to his office hours when I was nearly failing the class and he was completely unresponsive. So yeah, he might be a nice guy but that doesnt mean hes a good teacher., He has current, in-depth knowledge about distributed systems, but is quite absent-minded. His class was structured poorly though (maybe because its the first time he took it). We had a lot of papers to read, and the projects were very difficult. I wish I had worked much more harder, would have got a better grade. He doesnt curve on grades btw!, CS149 was def a highlight of my semester. Ben made the class interesting, and inspired me to learn more and o more. His exams are not to hard if you are study for it using his homework, yet the programming assignments do require a good understanding, so dont procrastinate, start early and ask him questions., I really don\t understand the review that complains about the PROFESSOR being too smart, as if that\s a bad thing (c\mon people). It\s as if people want easy As without learning any real career skills. Yes, the tests were hard, yes the homework was hard. But Ben was there every step of the way, and clearly made sure we would finish successful., This professor is super nice, knowedgable and funny. Class is pretty hard, but hell help you get through it. If you dont understand something, ASK! Programming assignments are somewhat on your own, make sure to do the homework, and make a lot of friends/study groups. Subject is definitely hard, but bens a great teacher., Do homeworks early since you will struggle researching on your own. Read the textbook and answer the questions he gives on canvas (gives you a good idea of whats on the exam). Pay attention when he writes on the board. Attending class is a very good idea - since there are no slides for you to reference later on. No pop quizzes. Office hours, go., If you dont work for your grade - youll get a low score. You have to put effort in teaching yourself and pay attention in class because it helps for hw and tests. Ben has a lot of work experience and will teach you USEFUL stuff. He has a lot of office hours - dont hesitate to ask him. DONT do homework last minute (< 5 days) :) pls. I regret., Wow, I am really surprised to see bad reviews. Ben is an exceptional teacher, who has TONS of relevant work experience and teaches you things you will actually use in your career. I wish all my classes could be taught by him - he works very hard to help you learn the subject, has a lot of office hours, and genuinely cares about your success., One of the best classes that I took at SJSU. Bens an amazing professor who is passionate about teaching OS and does his best for students to excel in his class. Hes always available whenever you need help. This class is challenging but worthwhile to take if you want to learn about OS. I feel motivated and inspired by him. Thanks Ben :), Bens such a great professor Ive ever met. Hes also a great inspiration to many students. He always wants his student to learn something and do well not only during class but also after class (interview, job, etc.) His homework is hard, but you will gain tons of knowledge out of it. If you want a good grade, you need to earn it. Nothing is free!, Oh my gosh, Ben is AMAZING! Hes such a phenomenal lecturer, incredibly passionate, super engaging and energetic. He kept me awake when other teaches couldnt. Its clear OSs are his passion and he genuinely wants you to succeed. Even though the material was challenging, Ben always provided us with more than enough resources to succeed. 12/10!, Super passionate about teaching OS. Replaces lowest exam with final and opportunities for extra credit. Office hours EVERY weekday. Highly receptive to class feedback/suggestions. Lots of readings, self-studying/experimentation. Hard class, but youll learn a lot about OS, programming, industry, and life! One of the best CS professors at SJSU., Very nice professor that wants you to succeed and ties things to real life application. Very helpful during office hours. The hard part about his class is he wants you to do a lot of the learning by experimenting outside of class. The class is definitely doable but takes a lot of time and self-learning but is fairly applicable in real life., He does not deserve all the negativity I see here. You learn a lot of stuff in his class. Yes, the programming assignments are difficult, but if you go to class they are doable. Also, if you get stuck, he is very helpful in office hours. I think most people giving negative reviews might just be mad about doing poorly. I would take his course again., Professor Reed is a great person. He is always there to support you during his office hours. On the other hand, the class itself is another story. The programming assignments are definitely something you may have never seen before, and the unassigned homework should be graded to help motivate students to perform better in class., hardest professor ever. took this class as i thought other professor kong lee was hard. but this is even harder. very hard assignments (can hardly be completed). midterm very hard. most of class failed midterm. many students even dropped. he doesnt know how to teach. just laughs in whole class., Ben is extremely helpful if you go to his office hour. The class content is hard but youre gonna learn real useful stuff about operating systems., I as well thought Ben would be a good professor; however, this class has made me regret. Ben is a very knowledgeable and nice person; however, he does not have the ability to TEACH it to students. The programming assignments are 100% on your own. No slides to study off of, and he speaks to us in a technical manner as if we already understand., I thought this professor would be a good choice in the beginning because hes new. Was looking forward to his class, but after taking his class for 2 weeks, I realize his HW and tests are insane. His test are hard and nothing related to his lecture. Youre really going to need to study on your own completely if you take this class. Good luck!, Professor Reed is very passionate and talks about things that are relevant in todays tech field. He is happy to help and wants you to suceed. On the flip side his assignments are extremely individual research dependent and even with his provided tools the instructions make the project much more obscure., Ben is new but totally rocked it this semester. He is passionate about what he does and since he is fresh out of industry he has a very good idea of what students need to know before they graduate and makes sure you do. The course content is not difficult as long as you participate in lecture. Definitely go to office hours, they help A LOT., Ben is a really relaxed professor. His class is mostly lecture, for a lot of information is rote memorization. It is expected though. The coding assignments were really fun to do, they include utilities and libraries that were good to know. Only thing is that lectures are just retelling of the textbook. But the textbook is excellent, easy to read., Ben is a nice professor with a lot of experience in the industry. His assignments are sorted and very interesting. With the extra credit, he can be an easy A. The downside is you can get lost at times in his lecture. However, he asks questions during lectures so that helps. He has lots of office hrs as well."
Evan Merz,/professor/1888853,3.0,N/A,3.2,"Very clear lectures. Overall great Prof., If you belong in CS you should have no problem passing this class. If you put some effort into the assignments and study a minimal amount for the exams, you should be able to pull off at least a B.  Tons of us breeze our ways to As in this class. If you cant keep a B in this class you probably wont survive Upper Division CS classes., I honetly think that this teacher has worse reviews than he deserves.  This was overall an easy class but I was kind of lazy so I did cut it really close with an A-.  The homework is pretty easy and straightfoward as are the tests.  Most of the coding tests are open book, open internet, and open homework, making them a breeze., As with any CS course, you need to practice frequently to retain the material covered... and believe me, there is a lot of material to cover. Evan is a great guy with a really neat background. Most problems in this course stem from the CS department itself. If anything, Evan could do a better job managing his time towards the end of the semester., Ill be honest. I took him for 46B and this is where CS because the science of computing. Evan lectures and towards the end of the semiseter became lazy and still require us to know the material. He does give quizzes; a lot at the beginning and then few but it came harder. The structuring of the class is very structure and stuff. He seems legit., While 46A is an intro into Java programming, I believe 46B is meant to separate the wheat from the chaff. Merz has amazingly well thought out lectures. They are very concise and straight to the point. Never once did I experience Merz going off-topic. He is tough but its because he wants to make sure you know your stuff. Excellent but tough teacher, Nice teacher. Will help if you ask.  Make sure you do the labs and HW yourself, lots of  the quizzes are just the previous homework., Merz is a great comp sci teacher. If you show up to class, do homework and labs on time, youll get an A easily. He is one of the most patient teachers as well. People sit in class asking stupid questions yet he is still patient and is very open to help others. Funny guy as well. Anyone who says he is hard is lazy and wants an easy A Switch majors, I had Merz for CS-151 last summer. His lectures were clear  interesting. His industry experience as a programmer gives good perspectives that you dont get from most professors. Tests were very reasonable. Group projects were long  challenging in-class programming tasks were a mad race against the clock. Great instructor would take again., Helpful class. Recommended., Evan Merz is exceptionally friendly.  He is a younger professor so he relates well to students.  His desire to create a great class is sincere and obvious. Granted, he is somewhat inexperienced as a professor so he is still finding his footing. Nonetheless, I enthusiastically recommend him.  He wants students to learn and do well, and we do learn., In class programming tests were extremely unfair. My lab instructor was even surprised how difficult the exams were and he said it took him 4 hours to complete the exam when he tried it himself. All of students were only given 75min. There are some people who have done very well in the class but it is because they have learned the material before., I dont know what these ratings are talking about regarding impossible exams and 12 hour homework. Once I started reading the book, the class got easy. I admit I failed every in-class coding exam, but that was me being a bad student, not Merzs fault. Coding is new to us, many of these bad ratings are because its hard to learn. Its not his fault., Compared to CS46A, this is a real programming class and it will be hard, so take it seriously. I agree that he can be mildly hard to approach, but is generally friendly once you do. You CANNOT do his assignments the night before. Read the book, go to lecture and youll have enough of an idea to get SOME points on coding exams and quizzes., He expects you to know everything you learned in CS46A by heart. His coding assignments and quizzes are not that hard but his exams are just terrible. If you want to pass this class then you better do all your assignments and have B or better in the class before going into the finals., Merz is a good programmer, but not a good teacher. His expectations for second semester programmers seem unreasonably high, and he refused to give additional practice problems or recommend videos when we were struggling with recursion. I thought his in-class coding quizzes/tests were overly challenging and his javadoc hard to understand., Unless you feel like you know more about java than any professor teaching a course in java would, dont take Merz. He claims he is approachable for help, but he is actually very rude and will make you feel useless and stupid., I have programming experience so this was very easy. People saying he teaching is similar to realworld have not worked in the industry I assume. It is NOT like the way he teaches/codes,ask anyone in the industry and they\d laugh how stupid and absurd his code is. From simple things like method naming to logic, the industry does not work this way., Lold at 12 hour assignment, considering it all averages out to about 12-18 lines of code per assignment and use of the basic sorts, recursion, and data structures. Merz happens to be a pretty good teacher whos just starting out, and slightly inexperienced .hes friendly and approachable if you decide to talk to him. willing to help if you want, He takes the joy out of programming with his 12 hour assignments and impossible exams., If you actually like programming and arent only a CS major because you like video games, this class will be easy. expect to spend 1 hour per week on assignments. Exams were straight forward and not overly difficult. My only complaint is that Merz is too tolerant of people talking during lecture., He expects far too much from his students, but does not give them the tools necessary in order for them to succeed. He is very unapproachable and it almost seems as though he takes out his own problems on his students., If you like computer science then you will succeed.  Good professor if you are interested in learning.  He provides relevance to otherwise relatively abstract concepts., Very condescending guy that you wouldnt want to be near. If you arent a great programmer, youll end up not liking him. He made a programming exam very difficult to fully complete within 1 hour and never curved it. So expect to be stressed out in his courses., If you want to stay away of having an 80% risk of failing the class, dont take this professor. His exams are extremely hard. He wants you to do a perfect score in 75 min of exam time which is coding in class and his coding exams are very hard that it will take you about 4 days straight coding if you want to receive full points otherwise it be a 0, This was the worst instructor I have ever had. He is very condecending and useless. He could care less about his students and does his hardest to make sure no one is able to pass. He is very unapproachable and is just shy of forcing you to change your major. Do yourself a favor and stay away."
Vidya Rangasayee,/professor/2039795,2.6,30%,4,"Professor Rangasayee is a wonderful DSA Professor. Though this is her last term at SJSU, I am reviewing her because this class was an eye-opening experience and great prep for future upper division CS classes. She may not be a quick email responder and takes time to grade, but is very nice if you ask for help and cares about your success., I already did my final. Yet the grades for half of my programs are still not in yet. You dont even know where you stand. She also looks very dull as if she hates when students ask her questions. I wont say this was a very challenging class as there was extra credit opportunities but the final was hard. But I would chose a different professor., Grade was made up of coding hw assignments(40%), 2 midterms(15% each), and final(25%). Only assigned 6 hw assignments and gave little feedback. Exams were a nightmare with 0 review and she was very inaccessible for help. Dont expect things to be graded quickly. Exams werent curved at all despite the averages being 56% and 63%. She doesnt care., Very rude when asked questions, not very responsive. Makes questions which are vague and acts surprised when its interpreted in multiple ways. \n\nDoesnt curve grades for midterms or show an accurate representation of your performance at all. You have no idea whats going on until near the end of the term or if you somehow calculate yourself., Homework took many hours to complete, usually at least one coding assignment every week. The lectures were helpful but make sure to set aside a minimum of 10+ hours a week for this class. The midterms were pretty tough. Do not take this class if you want an easy A; take this class if you want to understand the topics and concepts., Her lectures are very helpful and provides many in class examples to explain the topics. The class is do-able, but need to put in the extra time to study. Midterms are pretty tough and theres one hw coding assignment a week that is pretty challenging. Also gives out ec throughout the semester., Grading system was very generous as 50% of it was the homework assignments. Tests were not that difficult. With an extremely stressful semester, this was my favorite class and professor. She gave me the least amount of stress. Show up to class, watch the videos, and youll do good., Previously I was on edge as I heard bad reviews.  This semester it seems, her teaching has gotten much better.  Lots of extra credit, assignments worth 50% of grade, and her lectures are very well planned this semester., Professor Rangasayee knowledgeable of Object Oriented Design, and I learned a lot in her course. Her class is fairly programming heavy so be prepared to write some small applications. Her tests are mostly based on past homework assignments, but there may also be topics specifically from the textbook. Overall a solid choice for CS 151., Vidya struggles to teach the material clearly to the students. She has slides, which barely explains anything, and she talks rather quickly in lecture. She creates diagrams on the whiteboard, but isnt clear of what is going on. We had to self learn alot of the material to do the homework and exams. Homeworks are graded very tough. Get a good group, Awkward lectures. Teacher cannot find connection with students. She is unorganized, confusing. Find solid team for group projects. Be ready to teach yourself everything. Online midterm and final. Grading of the HW is merciless. Be ready that you will be smashed with the final project and the last 2-3 HWs. Try to take it with another professor., Terrible professor. For example, she guided us to do for homework, but grader took points of on that. She is not very responsive if you send an email, and very slow grading. Also, dont trust what she puts on syllabus about grading policy. It is very difficult for you to know what your progress for her class is., She talks in the whole lecture and seldom writes, a disaster for visual learners. She often arrives 10-15 min late for office hr and leave early sometimes She seldom pointed out my mistakes in my hw during office hr, then grader would give me low scores. Class HW avg 80 Tests are too long to be finished. Her exams are online, so many stu cheated., OK professor, Ive had better. Stopped going to class midway because YouTube tutorials teaches me better and I just read the textbook. Oh and she doesnt grade your homeworks or midterm until like a month later so good luck knowing where you stand in the class. Assignments are 60% of the grade, find good group-mates to survive., Very disorganized. She would make mistakes and even lose focus during lecture (students had to correct her). She changed rules for the class many times, which caused confusion. Lecture slides and homework correlate little with exams, use Google to study. She even procrastinated with grading. Class averages were Fs before curves (which were small)., She was quite disorganized, used slides straight from the textbook, and mostly read off of them. Came up with examples on the spot which were hard to understand. Maybe because it was her first semester teaching 146. Despite this, she was very generous with curves and extra credit at the end. She is very approachable and helpful in office hours., Disorganized. Office hours limited, unhelpful and sarcastic. Copied 22 slides +homeworks from different websites. Expects you to already know everything by week 2 of the semester. Know C language. Go to lecture, she parrots the powerpoint back to you and jumps to different topics. Recommended: Youtube+ textbook+group study Good Luck., I didnt like her teaching style, she made lecture very boring and just used the slides from the book. I had a hard time learning in her class and her grader will tear your homework apart. She is very slow when it comes to putting in grades. Dont take her unless its your last option, Lectures arent very organized, not easy to understand/follow, arent interesting or engaging; theyre very plain. Gives you a lot of time to do the homework, so start early or youll regret it!! Her homeworks/projects are not something you can do in just one day. Not very good at teaching new concepts or the material. Good luck teaching yourself., Her assignments are interesting, fun and hard and shes caring and kind. But very unorganized and hard to take a note.  If you like to read a book and study yourself and learn from doing homework then yea take it. But if you want to learn in class and understand the material before starting hw, then not recommended., Prof. Rangasayee is definitely one of the best CS instructors youll meet. She used to work for major companies (Google, Amazon, etc.) and is VERY knowledgeable. Most people in the class complained about assignments not having extensions but she gives you a decent amount of time to complete these assignments (2-3weeks). Would take her class again., One of the best CS professors I have come across. She brought cookies and muffins in some classes because the class was during lunch hours and none of us would participate. Assignments are difficult but interesting. Made me finally get into some real coding action. Not an easy A. Easy to fail though. Name your hw file wrong and embrace the zero., She used to work for Amazon, and she will teach you skills that are useful. Her lectures are boring at times, and you might get lost. Shell tell you whats important and what isnt. Tests are based on notes and the codes she uploads. She gave the class 3 weeks to do a project that had 11 pages of instructions. There are curves and Extra credits."
Alexandra Chakarov,/professor/2709680,4.1,79%,3,"146 is hard conceptually, but she makes you focus more on coding than theory, which made the class easier. Couple of HWs are tedious so get ready to debug for hours. Quizzes are easy and the grading interviews are simple: she asks you to walk her thru how your code runs the problem she shows you. Only negative is that lectures can get confusing., i took her earlier for 46b. Compared to some of the other prof that teach that course, she is a good one. Sweet, caring professor and you can actually learn from the lectures. She does activities every lecture which might be annoying, but it helps learning material a lot. Tests are pretty straight-forward, no curveballs. Take her if you can., Really enjoyed Professor Chakarov for CS146. For me, the concepts and algorithms were broken down and explained well enough for learning for the first time. The visuals on her slides are effective and shes very responsive in and out of class. No exams/tests, just strictly hw, coding quizzes, 2 grading interviews, and a lightning talk at the end., Professor Chakarov was fairly average. She explained concepts during lecture well enough, but I felt like I didnt fully understand those concepts until I applied them on the homework or labs. Theres some opportunities for a bit of extra credit if you do the in-class exercises. Also, she answers literal last minute questions on the class discord, Approachable, speaks clearly in not boring way, records lectures, slides online, syllabus publicly available. Tests and final were not too difficult. Hardest part of course was when we got to linked lists and material after. Take advantage of lab instructors and in class learning assistants., Her lectures provided basically almost everything you need to know. No surprises. Her tests are based off lectures, in class exercises(extra credit opportunity in test category), and short quizzes from labs. She has a discord server and is easily reachable for help. Do HW early. HW is graded VERY thoroughly, so test every possible outcome in code., Awesome lecturer and was very approachable. Homeworks were slightly on the more challenging side; however, because of this, it helped me understand the topics even better. Doing the in-class exercises and participating in-class activities is important as it will help you improve your understanding of certain topics., The topics taught in class seem pretty straightforward and understandable, but then when they show up in the homework/labs, it feels super difficult. These homework assignments will eat up your time, so you definitely need to start them as soon as you can. You honestly learn the most from your labs thanks to the lab instructors., Decent lecturer and good personality, but there are so many mistakes / typos in homework. Most homeworks had at least one mistake, most of which require clarification. Labs are extremely difficult and many times multiple groups couldnt finish in time. Lab grading style changed mid semester., Intelligent + teaches topics well. Grades very generously + has resources like assistants, labs, etc. Assigns 1 hw every 1-2 weeks, but exams are handwritten. Pacing of topics + time spent on each thing is sometimes badly planned. Lecture slides arent always helpful just diagrams + she expects us to code by ourselves with no knowledge. A w/ effort, Professor Chakarov is a good professor overall. Her exams are written and her lectures are helpful. The homework is challenging, but somewhat fun since you are learning something from it. During lectures there are in class exercises that can also help with learning a topic in order to understand it better. Great class., Really nice person and an easy class. But a new professor, so lectures are a bit confusing and she doesnt explain things the best way, slides are clunky and often cant be understood without the lecture. Also she stops for each question. Class is easy, quiz every week is pretty straightforward and labs/hw are for completion. No midterms., Had a hard time paying attention in class. Weekly quizzes in lab out of 10, but she grades fairly. Just review her lecture slides. The final was not too difficult, but a little long. HW assignments have interviews which aren\t too difficult if you know your stuff and did the HW correctly., The professor gave very good feedback and quizzes were fair. Her explanations were good and detailed. The final was a NIGHTMARE, though. I was extremely long and the questions were very different from quizzes. Plus, the test formatting was HORRIBLE. Class was good, but very disappointed on her choice for the final., The difficulty of course was moderate. We had weekly quizzes which were not that easy to score unless you have studied this subject nicely before taking this course. The final exam was subjective, many people ruined it as the exam was subjective and different from weekly quizzes., Quizzes every week, lowest two scores are dropped. Just review her slides before them and you will be fine., Lectures were awesome, especially because of the great animations to help understand each topic. Quizzes were lecture-oriented, so if you miss a class, you wont do well on quiz. But there are a lot of make up quizzes to replace lowest scores. The homework assignments and labs were fun., Takes the time to answer any questions during lecture, lab, or even office hours. Quizzes once a week in every lab, 1 hw assignment every couple weeks, no midterms, and a lab proj you work on every lab. She drops the two lowest quiz scores. If you actually pay attention during lectures and study you should be fine., The best CS professor I have had so far! Takes the time to explain each concept with plenty of details and examples. Definitely recommend to take her!"
Vinh Phat,/professor/88389,2.4,N/A,3.2,"He yelled because you asked a question that he doesnt know the answer. Ask him to help you debug a problem and youll see his reaction. He keep saying he is very smart and he can write program that run the first time with out compile errors or debugging it. He knows nothing about what he replay from books or materials., Very competent and nice instructor. He gave good advises after all these years., This professor has a very strong knowledge in OS especially the UNIX kernel. He cares. One of the best in CS., Well...teachers say there is no stupid question ...THAT\S WRONG FOR HIM.... if you ask a bad question, he\ll yell at you and say it\s stupid in front of class... and if you decide to take his class, dont\ fall for the touching story he tells you right before the evaluation form pass out..., the reason this joke of an instructor hates questions, is that he doesnt know the answer to them. the dumbest person teaching alive! hates teaching since he never succeeded in industry. thats what he really wanted to do starting out.  there should be no place for him in any teaching institution., has great knowledge and gives our good notes . but somehow he hates students asking questions (duh !) .\n a not-so-intellegent question is met with a swift verbal blow . exams are a joke (ever heard of a take home final?) . you wont get your HW graded until the coure is over . dont take it in summer., Very Informative and lot of good stuff to absorb, but unfortunately, you are on your own for the programs.. tip:ask around for past papers! :), This guy and his class were a joke... and not a funny one. I\m glad he\s retired and nobody else needs to be subjected to his teaching., No Comments, ****ING MEANEST PROFESSOR EVER.  DONT ASK HIM QUESTIONS UNLESS U WANT TO BE HUMILIATED.  VERY LAZY, LOSES EXAMS YOU TOOK ALMOST ALL THE TIME.  GRADE FOR CLASS WAS BASED ON 1 FINAL.  DO OR DIE., If you are smart, you will do well in his class.  He will slap down any dumb questions -- so dont ask any., You just have to keep quiet and do the work on your own.  He warms up toward the end.  Very knowlegeable and an extreemly fair grader.  I got a lot from this class., Professor Phat is horrible. He is very pretentious, and lacks grasp on material. Wont let anybody ask questions. If somebody gets a question through, he has been known to answer them incorrectly. Dont bother., He is trying to learn what he is supposed to be teaching, and hes trying hard. He doesnt earn or deserve any respect, but he demands it. Take him if you just want to pass. Avoid him if you want an A or to learn anything., Gives the same lectures for each class.  You will learn from the very hard programming assignments, just not necessarily the subject at hand.  Unlear about course requirements., Will insult you stone-age style for asking questions. Expects you to have known everything that he will be teaching., enthusiastic but does not have a grip on the class esp if you take the class in summer. dont take him in summer for CS 151 if you want to learn anything useful., Easy to pass his class, but he makes the class boring"
Wendy Lee,/professor/2565168,4.7,100%,2.9,"Excellent class with great structure. She is a wonderful person and a great professor, her lectures are clear and easy to follow. She provides lots of resources for us and gave us lots of freedom to do amazing things for the final project. Would happily take more of her classes in the future., Very good teacher, you can definitely get by without going to lectures but be prepared for exams - they are well made and will take every last minute of time., Wendy is nice, but the class is extremely difficult, chat-GPT put her on her alert, and if you do something so optimized, you fear that you will get accused of cheating, so you have to change your solution to something a dumb student would write. \n\nGraded by a few things, minor mistakes will tank your grade and make you depressed., What an amazing lady. Class was at 9am but she would show up and bring us zombies alive. Has an interesting story and is very fair/understanding. If you do all the work you can receive an A in the class, especially given midterm/final are worth 10% each. I will say the class does slightly skip over the statistics you need to fully understand, She gave quizzes around an hour after lecture started to measure participation. You can just ask a friend attending the lecture for the code which is what I did. Thus I never attended. It is pretty easy to fall behind in the class. Make sure to catch up before exams., Prof Lee was really nice, funny, and her lectures were quite engaging. Her final and midterm were only 10% and were quite straightforward. You can tell she likes teaching and is always open to answering your questions. Attendance may not be mandatory but BEWARE she has pop quizzes that are easy but if you miss them it can hurt your grade bad., Uses online custom made tutorials to teach. She helps out and is very responsive. Wants you to really learn., One of the best professors Ive had at SJSU. Gives enthusiastic lectures that are easy to follow. No textbook, most of the material was on her website. The course covered several modern bioinformatics tools and topics, with some cloud computing concepts at the end. Easy CS elective with minimal homework., GOATED TEACHER, a teacher who actually teaches. 1000% would recommend. She sets you up to pass just wait till you see the way she grades, as long as youre actually trying., An interesting CS class, and Wendy did a great job teaching it. You do data analysis/visualization and even some ML towards the end. Hands-ons are straightforward and dont take too long. Midterm/final exams are kinda long but very much doable. Theres a partner project but its not hard at all. Wendy also changed up syllabus a bit to help us :), Not difficult and you get to learn a lot. No reason to not take this class., Great prof! Very caring! Brought donuts and coffee to encourage attendance! Very simple and straightforward hw and exams. Understand the material and youll be fine! Put in the work and easily get an A. Very very caring. Lovely! Very passionate! One of the, if not the best, CS Prof SJSU has. Zoomed online as well as in person to accomodate., Took her for Adv Python. As a Python noob this class was somewhat easy/chill. Her lectures are quite thorough and detailed. Its easy at first but ramps up in difficulty towards the end, so its important you dont fall behind. Other than that, very kind professor and teaches well., I really enjoyed Professor Lees class. Her lectures were interesting and interactive. The class is revolved more around hands-on work rather than exams which didnt weighed that much in class which I found really meaningful. You also learn a lot about many different popular Python libraries that can be applied in future projects., Took this in SP 20 when classes transitioned online. She was very accommodating to help ease the transition. Originally there were 2 midterms and then a final, but the second midterm was changed to a project upon student request. The project itself was pretty tedious, but not bad. 8 homework assignments that were fairly straightforward., A pretty good professor overall. Lecture slides and recordings are posted online. 8 HWs, 10 labs, a midterm, project, and final. The midterm (Lockdown Browser) was on the harder side. The project was certainly doable but there was some confusion in the instructions. The final wasnt too hard and used Codecheck, which was laggy and created issues., Professor Lee is really good imo. She is understanding, helpful, and makes her lectures fun. I learned a lot even with the transition to the pandemic. She uses a lot of real-world examples which is useful. Professor Lee also really breaks down everything to make a complex concept really simple. She got some jokes too. Take her if you can <----, I really enjoyed this class. The course consisted of two midterms and a final. The first midterm was very hard, but she allowed a cheat sheet. The second midterm was a project she created due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a really fun assignment. The final was a free response test (which is much better than multiple choice imo)., Most of the assignments that she gave were good applications of what we were learning in class. She is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and seemed very responsive to student questions. Lectures could have been more engaging but overall enjoyed the class."
Ricky  Chan,/professor/3038081,2.4,46%,1.9,"Pretty easy class with Prof Ricky, and while I do like the group projects I wasnt really a big fan of how we had to sign up for SVIC. I want to build things, not be an entrepreneur. Pretty much all of our DSA learning was David Taylor videos which was kinda meh. The poor ratings below are kinda overblown imo, all things considered we got off ez., This course is not what you expect, its tough but rewarding. Youll learn DSA and essential soft skills, likely work on a group project, and may enter the SVIC competition. Balancing it all is hard, but worth it.\n\nRicky cares deeply about his students. He always made sure to get my AEC testing set for every midterm. Be ready to work hard!, This professor prioritized promoting a startup competition, over teaching DSA. Grading was unclear, often delayed until the last day, leaving no chance for corrections. He responded to students grading concerns unprofessionally, calling students disappointing in emails.\nIf you want to make a start up and not study DSA at all, join this class., He does not teach anything related to data structures at all \nUnfortunately he thinks he is doing something great while his class is not worth a single penny \nEven worse, he is not willing to take any form of polite criticism, Got a free grade but I learned absolutely nothing from this class. Aside from what others have said, sometimes he sent out emails at 11pm the previous night to tell us to attend the next mornings class. He said they were very important but all we did on those mandatory classes was watching David Taylor videos or listening to his SVIC stuff., This class was supposed to teach ds&a, but it quickly devolved into a semester-long convoluted project. Literally has no structure, everything just made up.\n\n Absolutely the funniest professor everif the joke is that this was supposed to be an actual DSA course. Assignments came with no rubric or feedback. If you enjoy guesswork, youll love it., This class was supposed to teach ds&a, but it quickly devolved into a semester-long free-for-all of poorly explained projects. \n\nAbsolutely the funniest professor everif the joke is that this was supposed to be an actual DSA course. Assignments came with no rubric or feedback. If you enjoy guesswork, youll love it here., didnt learn much about DSA, and the grading criteria and rubric were unclear for most assignments. There is a semester long group project which is worth about 20% of grade and replaces final exam. All quizzes are from prof taylor, 2-3 attempts given. we watched prof taylor videos the first half of semester and discussed projects the second half, If you want to learn DSA, this class is not for you. I dont think this professor can teach DSA since every time he would be asked the question about David Taylors videos - there was no clear answer. Dont think you can self study for this class. Taylors videos are great but without explanations and clarifications it will be hard to study DSA, This class was supposed to be DSA, however from the start we were encouraged to do startup projects. Most assignments and workload were mainly focused on the projects, leaving the main concepts of DSA far behind. Unorganized class with unclear expectations, and confusing grading. Main focus project - with no rubric and no feedback all semester., This class failed to meet its objective of teaching DSA, turning into a startup-focused course centered on the professors competition. The lack of structure left students confused and unprepared. Even Taylor was shocked at how poorly it was run. Grading was delayed until last day, causing chaos and unfair stress. Overall, a bad experience., Accommodating and nice prof, but this class was a waste of time. He didnt lecture at all and forced students to enter a competition that HE ran. Easiest grade ever but I learned nothing. Class was incredibly disorganized. Note that other reviews only rate highly because of a free grade, but I guarantee they learned nothing about data structures, I found this professor to be very kind and flexible. Time and time again he would put effort into teaching essential skills that were applicable to life after college, which I greatly appreciate. This class also gave me the opportunity to practice my pitching skills and develop my presentations! Never have I had a class that taught me so much!!, Completely self study class. I dont think the professor knows anything about Data Strucutures of Algorithms since he could never answer the classes questions about the topics. Self studying is kinda hard since the quizzes are from David Taylors class and are super hard., Professor used chatgpt openly to create assignments in front of the class. Did not have a single lecture slide of his own content. All of his content taught is borrowed from David Taylors class. I genuinely believe this professor does not know anything about data structures or algorithms., Ricky Chan is unorganized, relied heavily on videos that were from David Taylor, and did not answer any questions. Professor forced us to sign up and attend an uneunecessary competition (that he runs) for our grade. If asked a question, he would tell you to ask chatGPT or would promote his chatbot (CollegeBot)., Professor Ricky is very nice. There are several programming assignments throughout the semester, several take-home quizzes based on video lectures every week, plus 2 midterm exams. He is good at listening to students ideas and opinions and is very flexible. Based on students opinions, he would like to change his teaching style accordingly., There are quizzes every week,and some project(semester?midterm exams are both multiple-choice questions. The final exam is only a team project. Video is the main learning method in class and Ricky will also listen to everyones opinions and adjust the end time of the project,HW Overall, this course is more inclined to self-study, Only good for easy A. Not good for DSA. Take this if you know you are doing things outside of college that will make you a successful SWE or coder. Very good for self motivated people, who do not need classes to teach them this stuff. College is a scam, and an even worse scam when the professor doesnt teach you and gives you a bad grade., He Does not teach DSA. He is a nice person though and is an easy grader. Take him if you want an easy class, but not for learning., If youre serious about learning DSA, avoid this class. But if youre just after an easy grade, it might work. Youll also have to join the SVIC competition, giving updates every two days. Most of the class is spent watching Dr. Taylors YouTube video and doing his quizzes without guidancetheres no actual teaching., Handful of programming assignments, weekly videos and their corresponding quizzes. Final is a group project to work on throughout the semester and he offers some extra credit. Overall great professor, very understanding with deadlines, cares about students input. Attendance is important, many details talked about in class, not posted on canvas., online canvas take hom quizzs weekly due sunday-are very doable, some are difficult.. there are a lot of them so even if u dont do well its ok. mc tests & gives 50 question practice before & pulls 20 questions out of those(very doable). So far have an A. final: project or exam (u choose). Shows taylor vid in class, doesnt teach himself. Self-study"
Robert Bruce,/professor/2083141,3.1,45%,4.1,"Professor was grading strictly at the start of semester but started boosting grades towards the end. His grading scheme is very difficult. You will need a 93/100 on canvas to get a B+ as he does not have a A+ grade unlike other professors. He is a wonderful teacher, shares lots of experiences and stories. Loved him. Just a very tough grader, He initially tries to intimidate you into working hard for this class but finishing assignmnets isnt too hard if you have decent writing skills. Just use his rubruk and its not too hard to score full points. Most people who dont score well, dont listen to his recommendations or dont read teh rubrik. Dont Plagiarise, use TurnItIn! Big deal!, He is a difficult person to crack. One suggestion is to listen to his feedback. Discuss it with him and he will explain you the mistakes whole heartedly. After the semester ends, you will definitely notice the improvements in yourself., Do NOT take writing class with him. Or he will be your nightmare for a whole semester!, this professor takes a technical writing course which is just a requirement for graduates and behaves as if he teaching a Core subject. He makes sure he treats everybody very very very very critically. He does NOT give a good grade at all. He is a complete self boosting, pessimistic, and unnecessarily hyper professor. Better to NEVER take his cours, DO NOT take CMPE 294 under this prof. His grading is tough and if his class is until 9.00PM he will give in class assignments and make you stay in class until 10-10:30PM. Sometimes even leaves the class and makes you stay and asks to switch the lights off., Semester long group software project that requires working with various C++ Computer Vision libs to implement a face detection pipeline and web application. Chill 25 min group presentation at end of semester. 1 short midterm and final. Learned useful technology, project implementation is open ended but you need C++ knowledge to work with libraries., I would not recommend taking any class under this professor, this professor does not give any chance to students to explain themselves even if the mistake is trivial but still he takes such small things to high level committee. He is rude sometimes.  He is a very difficult person to talk to., Class consisted of short midterm and final, and 5 overarching programming assignments that explore interesting topics. There is a lot of self-learning and reading to do to complete the assignments, but it imparts some valuable knowledge related to computer graphics. Great professor, really made taking computer graphics at SJSU interesting., Hes willing to answer any question you have, but he takes too long to grade assignments. I have no idea if Im gonna pass this class, its really scaring me not knowing how well I did up until now. Sometimes hes unclear, whole class had to redo assignments. He is very picky on requirements., Class was an intro to computer graphics so was very shallow (most topics glossed over instead of teaching implementation). Interesting lectures and 3 programming projects. 3 very short (some 15 question multiple choice) exams  worth a total of 50% of grade (short can be a bad thing if you miss even a few questions). VERY slow grader on projects!"
Genya Ishigaki,/professor/2804449,3.7,67%,3.2,"Genya is a great guy, super accessible outside of class. One of my favorite professors here at SJSU. Make sure you take advantage of his office hours., I have been taking CS272 and absolutely love how the professor has structured the course. Of course, the course is challenging, it is RL and involves a lot of Math intuition. The prof breaks down each concept in class with explanations and coding exercises and then drives home the concept through homeworks. I would 100% recommend his class!, yeah dude, I totally understand. I am also taking his CS 272 Reinforcement Learning class and hate it!\nThere weren\t other classes besides Machine Learning and Graphs and Topics in ML being offered.\nDue to schedule conflicts was forced to take this class. \n\nBro, the concepts are hard but his class setup is not good. Tricky hw/exams/quizzes!, Im taking this dudes master level CS 272 class and honestly wish I had the choice of taking other professors. \nHe purposely tries to trick you on the quizzes and exams. He makes the class way harder than it already is.\n\nI genuinely regret taking his class but I need it for graduation! \nI hate his teaching style and the difficulty of the exam que, This was one of the only classes I took at SJSU that made me feel like I learned knowledge/skills/tools that are actually useful and applicable to the real world. Content covers the fundamentals of navigating unix & data presentation via Google colab. Easy, open-note exams, pretty easy and (most importantly) interesting homework assignments. Great!, Great class, covered most of the Unix / Linux fundamentals. Assignments built confidence and were somewhat difficult but not too much so. Prof. did a great job providing a practical learning experience built around the how of processing big data, if not as much the what. I felt like a Linux master after taking this class., I dont usually write RMP reviews but I figured I would here b/c nobody else has. Class is Unix, you learn the fundamentals of scripting and manipulating files with Unix commands. Decent amount of Git/Github work where h/w is submitted. Hes very knowledgeable & helpful in office hours, knows the material well and will help. Start H/W early., Rating 4 grad class which isnt listed here- his accent is very difficult to understand, his office hours always clashed wid my other course timings, how am i expected to meet? If you are that hyperactive first bench student who asks doubts just for the sake of it, you will get all the good grades, he clearly is biased, had a really tough tym coping, Pretty manageable class. No final, 3 non-cumulative exams total. Taught the material well and you definitely know what to expect for the exams based on in-class examples and hw. 3 hws that are industry applicable. Also curves overall grade."
Qi Zhang,/professor/222459,1.9,0%,3,"Very bad teacher do not take him if there are other choices pls. If there is no choice have a good group so you can help yourselves out, Nice guy, tries to help, but Im paying way too much for my education, He shouldn\t be teaching. He\s not good at teaching at all. He always compares smart students with you. exam/quiz is unfair. Do NOT take him if you want to learn something. He doesn\t know what he\s doing, talks about same stuff over and over., he seems really enthusiastic of teaching and explaininng stuffs. He repairs his note carefully and really try hard to help student landing a good job., He does not know much about the subject, cannot answer questions when students ask., u don\t know what he is doing + he doesn\t know what he is doing.  Limited knowlege and limited english. He always compare u with his proud student. Fortunately, he doesn\t teach at SJSU anymore., Grading students with his own tiny knowledge, not from CS background, is not up-to-date with a lot of new stuff.. only cares about what he sees, doesnt care about the inside since he doesnt understand it, He tries really hard to help his students find a job. The downside is he cant teach. Since he has probably has been working with T.Y Lin a lot, he teaches just like Lin--an 80 year old man."
Chandrasekhar Mukherjee,/professor/2803427,1.0,0%,4.9,"I had a terrible experience with this professor. Tests are super hard, the average midterm score was a 50%. There were no curves for the midterm or final. He grades based on attendance which is against school policy but disguises it as Participation. Doesnt matter if you participate, if you dont show up, youll get points taken away. Stay Away!!!, Awful teaching & awful structure, I dont know how he becomes an instructor at SJSU. \n\nI do know my neighbors cat can do a MUCH BETTER job indeed., This professor always arrives late. He never took track of time so we were very behind on topics. Only gave one assignment and forgot to give the rest which made the final 70%. For the midterm there is no clear structure. All he does is read off of slides that are not his. He is not fit to teach so avoid this professor at all costs., Avoid this professor at all costs, Was frequently late to class throughout the semester. Does not hand out study guides and says refer to the slides for review. There was supposed to be a project and some homework assigned, but due to time management issues, those were ignored and decided the final would be worth 70%+. Will require heavy reading online. Avoid for CMPE 142, This Professor is very random. The structure of the class is ambiguous and may change on short notice. The coursework was not relevant. Very very awful experience. Would not recommend it. Not a single perk."
Bryan Burlingame,/professor/1871955,4.5,75%,2.3,"This professor is passionate. He works at Microsoft and has years of programming experience. The labs are a little tedious since they are switching from C++ to Python but they make the transition feel smooth and he is very understanding. He really helps you understand during his office hours and he is very open to questions and feedback., Bryan works in industry who is also an engaging teacher. He is really in touch with students, cracking jokes and socializing before class. He also does a good job at explaining complex topics during office hours. I went to every single office hour and had a background in C/C++, so make sure you brush up with coding because the workload is 4/5 units, This class is gonna be a STRUGGLE if youve never taken C or C++. Definitely not a 2 unit class, should be 4. I spent at least 20 hrs a week just on hw and lab reports. Class was super unorganized and lab instructors were horrible and did not help students. Bryan is a good guy but hes always occupied with his day job, he doesnt respond to emails., Very good professor. Pay attention to lectures it will help you in lab. Heavy work load. Should be AT LEAST a 3 unit class. My best advice is read the book at least for the first few chapters so that you have the basics mastered or else you will struggle later. On the tests explain your thought process and put as much as you can down., Really a great teacher. He creates a very open and friendly learning environment for you to work in. Hes an extremely kind grader, sometimes even dropping two homework assignments and taking the best of two midterms. Be prepared to actually do your work though. Not showing up to class or lab will put you very far behind., Very smart teacher. Hes working at Microsoft. His teaching style works perfectly with students who dont know anything about programming and want to learn from scratch. Take him!"
Nooshin Tajik,/professor/2305330,2.8,40%,3.2,"I did not think that I could pass the class. She tried hard to keep me motivated. She was caring., Dr. Tajik really put lots of energy in class to create the momentum needed. She was a great and tried to go really deep into the matter. Overall I enjoyed her class., One of the worst professors at SJSU and I mean it. No clarity on what she teaches, very boring and confusing at times. Questions not clarified if asked. Tough grading. Avoid, No a good professor. Light on teaching concepts, very boring. Avoid, Her lectures and slides were very tedious and her teacher is very circular. She never clearly answered questions nor explained things easily. It was as if I had to teach myself things the whole way through and I was not experienced in Java prior to this class at all."
Sanjay Garje,/professor/2339374,2.8,25%,4,"Doesnt respond to mail from students. Guesses student ability through his hunch and reviews them negatively. My overall grade has been reduced because of this course and even though i had put more effort and done good projects., Learned a lot about AWS Technologies!, He only teaches and cares about AWS technologies. If you care and only want to learn about AWS technologies in regards to enterprise software then take his class., Wonderful way of teaching. Assures you know in and out of the topic."
Harmandeep Gill,/professor/2602814,5.0,100%,2.3,"Class was fair. Professor Gill is super nice and willing to help. The class isnt a free A but comes mighty close if you actually listen to his lectures a single time., Great Professor. Really caring and always tried to make sure that his students understood the concepts and application of what he was teaching. Always responsive to emails and happy to help students with questions during class. Overall great lecturer and would definitely take again. Told pretty good jokes too haha, The class was during COVID, so: - he had online lectures recordings -Used Microsoft Whiteboard (and other technology to teach) -Exams are SQL based and similar to the homework -Occasional quizzes are a bit challenging -Powerpoints do not contain answers, just questons -learned a LOT from him (SQLITE3), Hes an amazing person and teacher. Full time at IBM and part-time at SJSU so u see him now and then. His grading is very lenient and class is extremely easy to A. No need for books, just his lectures and slides are enough. Really inspirational, shares interesting and related stories in the industry. Well respected by the whole class, love the guy."
Tanuja Phadke,/professor/2285137,1.7,0%,2,"More than half the lectures were spent on group presentations and demos. Provides no comments or feedback on graded assignments. Not accessible outside class., Not recommended as a graduate course. Wont learn anything in this class. Easy A, Lots of presentations, theoretical course content, no midterm/finals. Can be taken along with 2 heavy courses."
Ethel Tshukudu,/professor/3029157,4.5,100%,2.3,"This isnt the best professor to start learning how to code with. Overall, shes really good, but really nit-picky with your code. For a beginner class, she expects you to create the most optimal leetcode codes possible without explicitly telling you to do so. Grading for homework and quizzes are often too harsh., Professor Tshukudu is an incredible professor who truly cares about her students success. Java isnt easy to learn, but she explains tough topics in a way that makes them click. Her many office hours have been a lifesaver, and her patience and encouragement make all the difference. Shes always there to help, and I feel so supported in her class., She was an excellent lecturer despite some accent. I barely knew Java before, and her lecture slides and participation problems/zybooks helped. I highly recommend this prof if you are taking CS46A. My only issue is that only a part of the midterm/final has problems that I wish we had been given more practice before. Still, shes the best!, CS46A with Prof. Tshukudu is definitely a blast. She is very nice, understanding and sweet. She definitely appreciates people taking initiative in class (answering questions, etc.). Awesome during office hours, has amazing connections and being in her good books can take you far. A lot of homework and practice, but it all helps towards your grade., Pretty caring if you ask questions. She doesnt speak very loudly and have an accent so kinda hard to hear her. Good thing is that her slides are clear and zybook reading helps. Lab is very important as it is mandatory and if you miss 3 youre dropped from course. Gives very good practice sets before exam as they are pretty close the same., she is a very smart professor. she cares about your learning and wants u to succeed. her lectures are a little harder to understand when the concepts get harder later in the semester, but the zybook readings will help a ton. dont worry, be open to participate in her class because it will make ur expereince better"
Nidhi Zare,/professor/2932442,3.3,67%,2.3,"Her lectures consist of slides and example classes, which are easy to understand. However, the material on her exams cover more than what she teaches. They will go more in-depth on topics she only mentions, not teaches. Theres barely any assignments for this class but she takes a long grading them. This class seems easy until she gives out exams., Easy class but lots of learning., Decent professor. Could slow down during lectures, exams and homework arent too difficult. Obviously, she is a new prof so we have to give some leeway. Decent amount of self-studying, but exams and quizzes are very similar to her slides--I have learned a lot so far!"
Ronald Gutman,/professor/2051781,1.0,N/A,4,"This guy is all over the place. I learned the whole course through the online website that is given to us. The website belongs to Stanford and I just watched all the lecture videos there. This professor is all over the place. He asks for clarifications from students whilst he is teaching. I just learned the whole course through online website., Do not take him. He does not teach anything because He does not know anything about Databases. He does not cover all topics from Stanford website. Project is crazy. He did not say specific things about it, but when we present He always complain why you do not do like this, like that."
Alberto Prieto,/professor/2292361,1.0,0%,2,"If you are trying to graduate, dont take his class. He doesnt care about his students at all. We are now done with finals, but we only know 30% of our final grades, the rest is still remain unknown. Exams and hw are ridiculously hard. Good luck asking him for grading your hw, cuz he just wont give a ...., He does not care about students. He has strong accents, so its hard to get what he says. 3 quizzes and 3 assignments. Need to work on a research paper and presentation as well. His exams and quizzes are terrible. His lecture is really boring. If you are not interested in Computer Network management, do not take his class."
Alpha Luk,/professor/2720713,3.5,50%,4,"Challenging exams, but ultimately very fair. Show up to class and pay attention to earn that A., Honestly, not that great. Its fine for introductory but I dont feel like the class sparked any major interest in the field for me. Some of the assignments were interesting and cool in theory but just really poorly executed."
Abhishek Gaikwad,/professor/2822613,5.0,100%,4,"Amazing teacher despite being a student himself. There is a group project towards the end. The exams can be tough but as long as you study and attend lectures, you should be fine. In this class, you dont have to depend on outside sources like a CS YouTube channel for understanding the concept., The professor is good and well-prepared. Grading is lenient. Was able to learn a lot of things related to Object Oriented Design."
Gayathri Namasivayam,/professor/1723087,1.5,N/A,3,She was pretty bad for her 1st year teaching. Lectures were boring and hard to understand at times. Tests were tough and had stuff we barely covered on it. Hws were usually easy but graded harshly. Rarely responded to emails and was useless when asking for help. Maybe with some experience shell get the hang of teaching but she has a ways to go...
Thadeus Aid,/professor/2132850,5.0,N/A,5,Gives you chocolate if he doesnt grade your assignment. Huge plus! Really really great at bribing students.
Saptarshi Sengupta,/professor/2834186,5.0,100%,4,Dr. Sengupta is an exceptional instructor. I learned a lot of practical applications of ML in this class. His expertise in AI also helped me get started on research that I used in my graduate project. I highly recommend his course for breaking into machine learning. The assessments were somewhat challenging but at least everything was open-book.
Sanket Kulkarni,/professor/2985741,1.0,0%,5,"Do not take Sanket Kulkarni. He is a TA, and his inexperience is strikingly apparent. His class is disorganized, instructions are vaguely worded, and test questions are rarely grammatically/semantically correct. He also expects students to know material outside of what he has assigned/lectured. His class is tough, and not because of the material."
Narayan Balasubramanian,/professor/2988718,3.0,50%,2.5,"Professor Balasubramanian took over our CS 146 class (though he only did teach a couple of the lectures).  His lectures were very well done, with fully worked examples which were not just the easiest problem in the textbook.  Really cares, and definitely worth attending lecture for.  Funny professor & engages well with students.  100% recommend., The Professor is new to teaching, and it is apparent. Teaches basics of AWS which can be easily learned online. His teaching style is very monotonous and does not engage the students. Does not talk about cloud from a distributed systems perspective. Rubrics for assignments and exams are not clear and are never posted on canvas. Not a masters class!"

Mike (Ching-seh) Wu,/professor/2285136,4.1,76%,3.3,"There are 8-10 pop quizzes that are easy if you review the material before class. He is not a great lecturer and rushes through the slides when there is no time. However, he is super responsive to emails and is a very caring. Go to his office hours and review the content yourself as he posts all the slides. The average in the class is high., Dr. Wu, go for it. The guy keeps making untrue posts to disparage you. This website is a joke. :-), I would say Prof is a nice teacher. He is under attack by many untrue and offensive posts in a day. I suggest he talk to his lawyer to take some legal actions., Thank you for your suggestion and positive messages., Professor Wu is very competent and knowledgeable professor on his subject area. He is excellent in term of doing his job as a professor. The HWs were difficult. but made us work hard and learn lot of new things. \nOverall, I thought he was a good professor., Excellent teacher, tests are difficult but he is fair in grading. Always willing to help at anytime of the day. Knows his stuff!, He is amazing! I love how knowledgeable he is on the material. His lectures are clear and concise. Ive learned so much just from his slides alone. Plus he is always very helpful outside of the classroom if theres something that I dont quite understand., Professor Wu is really a responsible professor. He was the best teacher I have ever had. I was referred by him and found a job as a software engineer at Amazon., Dr. Wu cares much about his students success and he is very responsive to questions. I recommend his classes., Homework is challenging but very understanding and useful. He explains everything clearly on all HWs. The course is structured well and industry oriented. Dont take his class if you want to fool around and get by., His homework takes as much times as all my other classes combined. Thorough, good teacher though. Each homework has you writing a long, detailed report with screenshots, an explanation, and use-case for each of the functions and classes of your code. Each report is 15-25 pages long. Good luck!, Challenging exams help us to pass technical job interview, frequent pop quizzes help us strengthen concepts and an interesting final database application project to finalize our sql/jsp/Javascript skills needed for future job interviews., By reading through all comments on this thread, I can conclude: good students like him and bad students hate him. I am a good student. Hahahaha, A decent professor and a great course for data science. I love the course contents in big data and ml technologies invented and used by Google. A very informative data science course with a potential job interview opportunity with Google., This is the best teacher Ive had! I didnt use the textbook but you have to go to class and take notes. Very understanding and nice dude. Pop quizzes are easy if you pay attention to his lectures. He replies email super quick and very responsive. Grading is not tough. Easy to get A., Mike is a great professor, but there are some caveats in his teaching. There are pop quizzes, but the difficulty of them is not of concern. Mike grades very leniently, he is the opposite of a harsh grader, he wants everyone to succeed. Sometimes he can give unhelpful answers/remarks over email, but during office hours he is more understanding., WowI sent him emails and asked homework questions at 2:30 AM (it was at 2:30AM) and he replied my questions right away at 2:40AM. He always responds quickly. Amazing Professor., I liked this graduate course very much. The topics were both industry and research oriented and it helped me on data scientist job interviews. I recommend this course to all  if you plan to work as a data scientist or data analyst role. Each homework assignment can be super time consuming and take several days to complete but it will pay you back., One of my best professors ever for all courses I have taken so far at SJSU. He is very knowledgeable and inspiring. I passed a technical interview and found a summer intern job as a database developer because I took his database course. \nA great course and a nice learning experience., extremely harsh professor. He failed me for missing just one quiz, hes really a difficult professor. He grades exams very harshly, allowing little room for partial credit. If a problem is worth 10 points, you might lose 15 based on his criteria. His expectations are unclear, and he seems to expect us to read his mind about what he wants., He is probably the worst professor I have had in my student career. He did not teach us anything besides asking all the students to do presentations on certain topics. He barely provided feedback, so I dont really know why we need him to teach us. I really like the course materials though. I hope this class is taught by someone else, but not him., Dr. Wu had great lectures and taught all the concepts well. Had pop quizzes, which would go over the topics he taught. Had a group project that would help you learn about Web-based application development. Friendly and willing to help as long as you put effort into learning. Provides information about interview questions and how to find a job., Great teacher. Great course. Pushing students to work hard. Very inspirational teacher. Pop quizzes often. Great learning experience from the Web-based Database application development project., unclear grading criteria on assignments and the final group project. Grades very harshly. The content isnt even hard, he just grades so harshly., Wow! Professor Wu. The lectures are hila, Great course and nice Professor. \nThere were tremendous materials of the 4 most popular types NoSQL databases introduced in this course providing us with a comprehensive learning experience through the hands-on exercises and very practical assignments. Be sure to attend each class to take pop quizzes and hands on exercise., Get ready to work! His homework takes as much times as all my other classes combined. Thorough, good teacher though. He will have you learning by the end. Each homework has you writing a long, detailed report with screenshots, an explanation, and use-case for each of the functions and classes of your code. Each report is 15-25 pages long. Good luck, Not the best lecturer, mumbles a lot and rushes through lectures. Too many pop quizzes (once he gave 2 pop quizzes in 1 class). HW is long and is of medium difficulty. Midterm and final were pretty hard. Group project is long so hope for good group members. But hes very responsive to emails and adjusts the class schedule as needed., Mike is an amazing professor who cares about his students. The class is not difficult but homework instructions are vague and can confuse you. Tests are not hard at all. He is very quick to respond to email. Lots of presentations including homeworks and final project. Be sure to show up to class because he does pop quizzes. Pop quizzes are easy., Really good professor. You will have to do a lot of self learning to understand topics. His Has take time and require extensive environment setup so start early. HWs are really informative and helpful. Has pop quizzes in class and make sure to attend all classes., Decent professor. His HWs are often pretty vague so students spam questions. This my 2nd time taking him, IMO his classes are often tough. Youll have to put in a lot of work for an A, especially for 157C and 146. DO NOT fall behind or its a guaranteed F. Other than that, hes generous with extra credit and postponing HW., I remembered Dr. Wu said in the class that he never gave crystalized clearly questions on HWs in case that students post then on Chegg for answers. You have to attend classes for detailed explanations. I would suggest not to skip any classes so that you dont have to fight for points. Topics are very useful for my job interviews., 1. Dr. Wu said that he never give crystalized HW questions in case that students submit it to Chegg for solutions. He also gave some examples too. I would suggest not to miss any classes for full explanations of HWs so that you dont need to fight for points. \n2. CS157C was well organized and very useful and beneficial to my job interviews., 1. Dr. Wu said that he never give crystalized HW questions in case that students submit it to Chegg for solutions. He also gave some examples too. I would suggest not to miss any classes for full explanations of HWs so that you dont need to fight for points. \n2. CS157C was well organized and very useful and beneficial to my job interviews., 1. Very unclear/subjective homework, although its (easy). Be prepared to fight for your points.\n2. Minimal examples or explanations in teaching, just reciting sentences on slides.\n3. Badly structured/shallow course: you will not acquire a deep understanding/intricacies of various databases in his class\nYou may wanna take Prof. Kims class instead, This is course is vast, Professor Wu introduces concepts at a high level so the course involves reading, you need to work hard on the assignments which are long so start early! The course is good for gaining knowledge in data engineering if you put in the work and Professor Wu is a great grader so dont worry about grades! Attendance is mandatory., Very caring professor. Extends deadlines for hw and exams. Written and programming assignments are tough, but they teach and reinforce the topics very well. Gives pop quizzes, access code given during the lecture. Curves the midterms/ final exams. Lecture slides are summaries of the textbook (CLRS). Overall great prof would def take again., He has a lot of experience and you can see that clearly during his class. He tries to focus on the information that will help us in the real world. He is extremely caring about his students. He always asked if we wanted an extension on any of the assignments. Midterm and Finals are straightforward and a big project you work throughout the semester., It was an incredibly informative class. I really enjoyed it and I use the foundational database skills I learned here all the time in group projects and my internship since I took it., The class wasnt the easiest, but I definitely learned a lot from his class. Theres one midterm, one final, and a group project. The homework given to you are very helpful for practice for the exams. I recommend reviewing them often whenever given the chance. The group project will require a demo near the end of the semester., Professor Wu is really a responsible professor. He is by far the best teacher I have ever had., Professor really cares about students performance. Grading is fair and he gives you the second chance to learn from previous mistakes and to improve your final grade. He a nice Professor., Yea not really sure what happened to him in the past few years, but he became a really terrible professor. He grades his exams extremely harshly, you dont have much space on partial credit. If a problem is worth 10 points you can lose 15 point according to his grading criteria. Extremely unclear and expects you to read his mind on what he wants., Professor Wu is very enthusiastic in teaching, and caring about his students. He is a tough professor but very passionate. Take him if you really want to have a job in IT career when graduating. Otherwise, I would recommend you not to take him. He provided tough homework and quizzes that help us concrete the knowledge., Not a fair grader, if you show up in his office hour every day and leave a good impression, you will get A for sure, even though you screwed up your midterm and final, thats not fair for the hard-working students who dont go to office hours. Hes exams are really hard, there is no way to get A, if he doesnt have the impression in you., This Big Data with Machine Learning course was a great experience because I learned new things and tools that help me found an intern. The course material was really useful and Dr. Wus experience with Google project was very inspiring; Furthermore, the practice homework assignments really help strengthen my knowledge and skill in data science., This is a hard class, but hes a good professor., This course was tough and very intensive specially in the summer short term. In less than 6 weeks, we have to build a full functioning database application. Its very time consuming. I would suggest go for regular semester with Professor Wu but not the summer. Hes a nice Professor very helpful outside the class., Each time when the assignment or exam come, he always say those are straightforward. However, at least half of people get C or lower grade on his midterm and final. It only shows how his teaching skill poor rather than how student cant study. All in all, you should avoid taking class with him if you dont want to learn everything online. (2/2), It\s a project heavy class to build a Full Stack Web App Development Using Java (JSP, JDBC, Java Servlets, and Javascript) and Tomcat Web Server. It requires tons of time/effort, in return you got a solid WebApp at the end that you\d be pride of. 4 HW\s took long time + be wary of pop quizzes, but they reappeared in Midterm/Final, so worth it., Tough class (long programming assignments + homeworks + tests) but hes nice and you can try to get some points back by talking to him. Transition to online this semester kind of screwed us all over but he tried to do his best and he just focused on the chapters from the text book (Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition by Cormen). Just work hard, Pros: Really cares for his students, assigns practical homework, & is super accessible/helpful outside of class Cons: Lectures can be difficult to follow; homework can be overwhelming as it is LONG; spends lots of time on irrelevant concepts, leaving no time for important ones. Pro tip: Participate & go to office hours as hes a subjective grader, Dr. Mike is very Knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the subject. He is an EXCELLENT teacher who is always willing to help and response to email quickly. Exams and HW are tough but very useful for my job interview. I am looking forward to taking his CS157A., Professor Wu is the nicest Professor I have ever had. He was extremely helpful outside of the class. Pay attention to key concepts in his lectures and you will do great on exams. HE IS A MUST TAKE PROFESSOR!, Professor Wu is very knowledgeable on the subjects he teaches, but he isnt good at teaching them. He zooms through concepts and assumes that his students have a lot of knowledge on certain subjects, and on a couple of occasions was fairly rude to students who asked about these subjects. He sent out a letter complaining about his poor SOTE reviews., Professor Wu is super patient to his students low questions in the class. It ate up a lot of lecture time and delayed the lecture progress. Overall a great course., Prof Wu seems very enthusiastic about the topic, keep repeating how his class will help people find an internship. However, for this semester we spend 10 MINUTE total to cover Graph+DFS+BFS, which are some of the most important topics for interviews. We also didnt cover RBT, NP problems. Miss almost a month worth of content. PA and HW back to back, His lecture source is too simple. He is looking teaching well, but his lecture is nothing to help. He requires complicated concept. However his hw require complicated skills. His group project is also burden since the projects require frontend and backend system(HTML, REACT, Javascript). so ALWays he makes his students ask him weird questions alot., I cant begin to tell you how amazing Dr. Wu is at his job. Hes the kind of teacher who will set a student up for success and will listen to the students to try to understand what he can do to better help them learn. Hes very flexible with due dates if the class tells him they need more time. Also hes not offended by people negotiating for grades, Exams could be tricky, but had similar questions to homework and lecture. Professor Wu was very responsive over email, and could be reached outside of class. I walked away from this RDBMS course feeling more confident in my knowledge of the subject. Prof. Wu wants his students to succeed, his actions made this clear. Overall a great Professor., Dr. Wu is a wonderful teacher and cares about success of his students. If you are looking to slack off and get by, his classes are not for you. To get a good grade, you genuinely need to work hard and be ready for pop quizzes, pop questions and challenging exams., The database project was the best part of the course. We can choose any programming languages we are comfortable with to implement the web based 3 tiered database application. Its very industry oriented and my first web database-driven product ever. Do a good work. Professor Wu also referred students to Google for internship or job interviews., His semester project is way outside the scope of this class and more fitting for a web-developing course than an intro-DBMS course. Difficult exams, blows through lecture slides that he takes from other universities and doesnt fully explain the concepts. Arbitrary grading criteria (one HW has no partial credit because reasons??). Definitely avoid., Truly cares about his students and by far one of the best professors in CS over my 3 years. His HWs and exams are difficult but very helpful to learn the concepts. He is very knowledgeable with industry experience and is very accessible. I sent him hw questions around 1am and I was surprised that I received reply right away. He is a great teacher., I had CS146 and CS156A from Professor Wu. He is AMAZING! He is my best professor at SJSU. He is always there to answer questions and help. Pop quizzes and exams are tough, but you gain a lot things from it. You will love the team database application project. I put it in my Github for my resume., He is not ready for his lectures with his test and projects yet. His tests and hw projects require much higher level knowledges, but his ppt and lecture sources are ridiculously simple and rough. Every week, pop quiz is provided. Final project : designing website with your team member. Almost 6-7units. His accent is also difficult to understand, Dr. Wu is a good professor, he tries to help students as much as he can (as long as you try as well). His exams are hard if you dont study, programming assignments are hard but you learn a lot from them. Homeworks are lengthy, so start early. Write down whatever he writes on the board, it can be on a quiz or midterm. Pop-Quiz every week, prepare, After CS146 with Professor Wu, I found that I have improved a lot of concepts and skills in data structure and algorithm throughout the semester. In addition, I have also gained more interest in coding after completing his tough assignments. Thus, I believe that I am almost well-prepared for my next coding interview after taking his CS146 class., Easily one of my favorite CS professors. The material itself is difficult and he understand that it is difficult. The programming assignments are very general as long as it fulfills his requirements. The exams and pop quizzes can be very difficult but he tries his best to curve your grade based on the class average. Overall, a very good professor., Really passionate guy. Programming assignments and tests are long and hard, BUT he is generous is giving you ways to make up your grade. This semester he let people redo their mistakes for partial credit for the first midterm, and curved the second and final. Try your best even when it gets hard and ask questions. He wants you to succeed too., Each programming assignment need to write a report. If your report is not good enough he will take lots of points off from the written report for example 50% deducted from your score even your code works fine. Tests are difficult and the pop quizzes almost every week. His attitude is kind only for good students., The class almost done, I will definitely miss him. He is the best professor ever. He is always there for us to help us out. Every time go to his office, and ask him questions, he always explain patiently. He even add extra office hours, and comes to the office often on Friday, or weekends to help us. The hw and projects are well designed., Its hard to understand him and reading textbooks is a must to pass the course. Coding assignments are back to back and very hard if you are not comfortable with to Java and data structure in CS 46A/B. His exams are very long and time consuming. You dont even have time look at his given notes. Pop quizzes once in so beware., Mike Wu is a great teacher. Hes very passionate about teaching and inspiring students to study well for industry jobs. Make sure to attend every lecture and stay on top of coding assignments. He curves and gives extra credits so I found his class easier to pass than other CS146 classes. Also, make sure you learn Java before taking him., I retook CS 146 and did so with his class. He will give you opportunities and chances to show that you understand the material and you get the grade you deserve. I was able to understand this subject better thanks to him and he will go out of his way to help you if you ask. You get an occasional laugh during class as well., This is the only review you ever need: 1- Prof Wu curves your grades and extends deadlines often (got Cs on midterms and final but total grade is B) 2- Tests are very difficult and long. 3-Assignment instructions are horribly unclear, but not hard. 4- Study everydays lecture for the pop quiz (seriously) 5- No laptop in class, I am in his data structure and algorithms class Spring 2019. I love his teaching style, funny, nice, and Knowledgable. One of the greatest professors Ive have taken at SJSU. Really cares about the success of his students. Very understanding and humorous guy. I am really enjoying taking his class., Professor Wu is super considerable and knows the connection between the material in books and the implementation in industry. He is trying to make all the students to catch up, and he spends so many time to help students to improve their performance of this course after class. He is always energetic and passionate during his lectures., Professor Wu is a vey nice professor. He gave interesting programming assignments, lots of assignments, and pop quizzes to make students learn. I recommend Professor Wu to those who want to understand and do well in Data Structures and Algorithms., Professor Wu isnt a very good professor. He cant even pace his own class. Im not sure if it was just our session or if the other sessions had issues too, but he would go extremely slowly at the beginning of the semester, then he would realize he was going to slow and try and speed through everything, not giving enough time to learn the concepts., Terrible attitude in class and out of class. Says that no questions are stupid questions but if you do ask him a question that he thinks is stupid, he will make fun of you in class. Really rude and hard to approach., He is great. I went to his office to ask questions and he was always very nice and clearly answered my questions. He wouldnt mind meet me on Friday or even Saturday because my class schedule conflicted with all his office hours., Dr. Wu is one of the best profs Ive ever had. Hes extensive industry experience and very knowledgeable in the field. After finishing my programming hws, I got so much great concepts of how Google search engine and Facebook work in using data structures and algorithms. I would say that if you dont miss class and ask questions, you should be OK., Gives long homeworks and projects so that there isnt even enough time to prepare for the tests. Doesnt explain concepts clearly in class, so a lot of it will rely on yourself being able to study. Test questions are very long as well, Really bad professor. Says you can email him or go to his office hours but there was a few times I went to his office hours to ask a question or debug my code and he didnt even try to help me at all. His tests are really long too, many people didnt even get to finish the midterms both times., Although Dr. Wu isnt the best lecturer in the word, he is definitely one of the best professors that Ive had so far. He is very knowledgeable and very approachable outside of class and always encourages you to ask him questions if you have any. He is a tough but fair grader. You will learn the concepts very well in his class., Professor Wu is an excellent Computer Science professor. He cares about the success of all of his students, and he tries his best to ensure everyone in his class learns the material. He can be a tough grader, but he is also fair. I would highly recommend him to any student looking to take data structures and algorithms., Professor Wu cares about the learning progress of students and is very responsive to questions. I learned a lot of concept and skills in Big Data from this course. Some of homework assignments are challenge and time consuming, but very useful and practical. I have found an intern job in Silicon Valley. This is a must-take graduate class., Dr. Wu is a really nice guy and cares about his students. He is so much more approachable than the other CS146 teachers, very responsibe email. Hes also flexible with deadlines when students ask for it (big life saver). Of course being 146 its still a challenging class. Very fair grader. Its not mandatory to attend but it helps you stay updated., Great professor and very knowledgable in the topics. I enjoyed his class very much., Dr. Wu struggles with teaching, but hes nice, respected and highly accessible. I love how much he cares about students success and his experience in the field (Google). His tests and assignments are not bad (hard sometimes), but I wish he could bring more coding interview questions to programming assignments. He grades easily, with curve, though., Wu is one of the nicest professors Ive ever had. He respects you as a student, and will go out of his way to help. His lectures are very mediocre, you will need to study to pass this class. The concepts are hard and you cant retain all the material by attending lecture. Wu will RECOMMEND YOU for jobs if you do well in his class and he likes you., Professor Wu is a good teacher. His teaching is kinda meh..... you need to spend time study more by yourself. But he always answers your questions no matter what time you email him. And his test is not that easy, but if you spend time perhaps, its not super hard either. Plus he gave lots of 2nd chances for students to improve if they doing badly on the midterm."
Ty Lin,/professor/18,1.4,25%,3,"Ty Lin seems like a great guy. Love his classes, always looking forward to them , because he is so nice and motivating., Ive never been more confused in all my school years. He is very disorganized. Teaches a topic at the end that is not available online, in textbooks or even through adequate in-class materials. Ive never seen the whole class so confused and disappointed in a teacher. Youve been warned., Not a good choice. Difficult to understand his english. Random lecture topics. Seemed unorganised and chaotic. However you dont have much of a choice with his subject., Database is an important class, so please dont waste yours on him., Adamant, vague, confusing. In the two lectures I stayed for, Lin was very insistent that we all have Visual Studio (even if it meant installing another OS). He threatened to drop anyone who couldnt get it, despite there being more viable alternatives to VS. The advice he gives is questionable; he told me the C# template I had was fine (it wasnt)., Horrible teacher. Barely lectures during class time, and continually talks about his project his students have contributed to over the years. Its nearly impossible to understand what he is saying; he doesnt clarify details at all. Gives sporadic quizzes 5 minutes after an unclear lecture. Probably the worst class Ive taken in my life. AVOID HIM., It is really easy class. If you get lower than B+, then you might need to switch Major. Class topic can be helpful for your study but lecture is NOT useful, Absolutely and unequivocally the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. You will learn very little to nothing from him and what he expects on assignments and tests is unclear. His communication skills, both written and verbal, are almost nonexistent. The class was a very long and stressful way to learn a little SQL from a textbook., Worst professor on earth. Harasses mentally. NOT fair with grading. Calls on weekends, holidays. His moto is to torture students, Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class., Worst professor I have ever had. Horrible lectures and repeats the same lectures over and over. Barely taught anything and never used the book. Tried to defend his poor teaching by showing student evaluations from 10 years ago and then bash the rest of the teachers as SJSU for not publishing as much as him., Dont ever take his subject. He is horrible, he takes tests but never grades them. U dont have to work in his subject and u learn nothing., Bad lecturer. Disorganized. Learned very little about assembly. Stayed on one topic for the entire semester. Keeps poor records of grades., Hes a great programmer but a pretty bad professor. Hes useless unless you can understand what hes trying to say. His teaching style can be described as authoritarian. Look, if you understand him and truly care about the subject, youll learn quite a lot. Otherwise, avoid., Worst professor i have ever seen. i dont understand what is he doing in San Jose State? Waste of time and money. Dont take this class unless you have to. Grades are easy to get, but you wont learn anything. Not a single word ! He doesnt even know what he is teaching. He neither understand nor speak proper English.. Avoid it guys...., Absolutely the worst instructor I have ever had. His lectures are unorganized, unclear, and repetitive. Taking his class was a waste of my time and money. Save yourself the trouble and avoid him at all costs. Lin should not be given the right to retire; he should be fired as soon as possible., The worst teacher. I got an A in the course, so I am not bitter. Previous reviews are true. A third exam a week before the final is proof of his disorganization. Waited until the final day to inform us that only the top 10% (out of 25 students) will receive As regardless of overall %. The head of CS has received many complaints about Lin., He really likes to talk about himself. He lectures about the same thing for a few weeks, which you dont learn anything new in the class. He does not have a set schedule, grading policy, or midterm schedule, so expect to take random quizes and midterms. Not recommended. He knows his stuff, but doesnt know how to lecture., Do not take this teacher. First of all he only speaks about himself most of the class time. Then he spents all other time giving quiz which he didnt teach. No only that, he doesnt give answers to the exams or quizzes if asked in the class. In many occastions he ignores student questions and not answer them throughout the class. He prefers you to, Sloppy, careless, and utterly incomprehensible. Also a hypocrite. Squawks about students not having the right attitude or not putting in enough effort, but puts in zero to no effort into teaching the class! He wore pajama pants under his jeans once. What a lazy professor! His tests and notes look like they were typed by retarded monkeys. AVOID!!!, Dr.ty Lin is the worst professor in the CS department. If only he would retire, since the Department cant fire him.  Please do the school a favor and do not register in any section he teaches.  I wont make that mistake again.  Nothing sucks the life out of a student, like a professor that just doesnt care., Lin is a joke. Not fair grading, doesnt teach a thing. Everything he does is confusing. AVOID if you can., The main reason to avoid this teacher, other than all the true things mentioned by other people, is that you dont have a clear understanding of how to be successful in this class. He changes his requirements on the fly and denies that he specified requirements in earlier classes. It is hard to succeed if you dont know what you need to do., No Comments, He doesnt know**** about this class. His accent  is extremely difficult to understand. His exams r HARD. You will not learn anything from him. U have to work yourself in this class. He is very unclear on his exams. Overall: 4 exams + Final + Project + Quizzes + Homeworks. Extremely BAD Teacher !!! Hes the worst teacher in the CS Dept at SJSU :-(, Very poor teaching and a very bad professor., Hell, at least at least he makes up for his lack of teaching skills by making you learn some most cutting edge comsci stuff... Not just the same old stuff at that, What everyone has said is right, he is a horrible professor.  Very disorganized, huge ego, no lesson plans.  He teaches things on the fly. He doesnt teach things and gives midterms on it(And on the midterm its very unclear). He gives points based on attendence, gives quizzes in which he doesnt look at them. I would recommend to avoid him., DO NOT TAKE, poor instructor, poor preperation for class, learn MUCH more just reading the book, huge ego (is always SURE he is right)  he must be tenure and he needs to retire or just care about teaching.. refund?, One of the only teachers who really cares about his students. Grading is on the overall performance but hard. He curves., terrible waste of time, complete lack of knowledge on subject material, did not bother to make a lesson  plan, covered about first two chapters in the text during the whole semester, had a guest lecturer come in and teach a whole chapter in two days, gave similar midterms 3 times, got answers wrong on one midterm that where right on another. and do, Should retire asap. very forgetful and unorganized, come up with new grading techniques every week, utter chaos and confusion, think 10 times before taking the class., In addition to everything said so far, Dr. Lin makes up his grading system as he goes and does not post anything to his website like he says he will.  Replaced the final with note taking and a research paper and then spends all lecture taking attendance.  This teacher should retire or go into research if thats his interest., This is the first class that I didnt understand what he taught in class. I think he is too old to be a teacher., -Sloppy\n -Unreliable\n -Boring\n -No teaching skills\n -Does not speaks proper english\n -Does not writes proper english (exam hell) \n -Avoid at all cost!, Absolutely the worst prof. Ive had so far. While hes a smart guy and made quite a few contributions to computer science, his teaching skills are non-existent.\n We covered, at most, several weeks of material.  Remember that CS140 is a prerequisite for several REQUIRED courses and you need to know the material taught in CS140 to have a chance there, TAKE HIM AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! has to be the worse teacher period.  even worse then Lee and Obaid combined.  this foo is so ridiculous, he spent 30 minutes in one class period just to defend himself after reading his last semesters evaluations., Prof. Lin is a HORRIBLE teacher! he cannot speak or write english at all, so it is impossible to understand nething he says or writes! His choice in text is even worse so forget about learning from that. He knows alot but cannot teach any of it! Stay away from this teacher at all costs!  You will not learn anything and be frustrated to no end!!!!!!, One of the worst teachers. He seems to know a lot, but he just dont know how to teach it to others. Hes lazy in everyway. Claims to be busy all the time, but he doesnt assign much hw, grade exams himself, or assign projects. Hes not a good teacher, so avoid if possible.  Hope I dont get him again., This guy is the worst. Hard to understand (the accent doesnt help) and unclear assignments (I had no idea what he was asking in any of them) make him guy you do not want to learn from. Avoid at all costs., Huge waste of time. Youd be better off just buying a good book on SQL., He often claims that common sense is not a part of databases.  Unfortunately common sense is a big part of quality teaching, and you wont find it in his teaching methods.  None of them make sense., Smart man. Accent makes understanding him a little difficult, but once you get used to it, its not so bad., Good:  This man is knowledgable in the subject matter.  Hes the president of IEEE SV chapter and has alot of connections.  He has a great project.                                        Bad:  bad accent, kinda sloppy, ugly hand writing, This guy knows absolutely _nothing_ about what he is teaching.  He doesnt understand English.  His assignments are gibberish.  He cant grade.  He doesnt have time for students.  Beware of his presentation of Two-Phase locking--most of it is just WRONG!, He teaches nothing. His way to grade students is unfair. If you speak in class, you will get a good grade. Even if you get a way above average in mid and final, you may not get A. Anyway, he is worst CS teacher I had taken before., A TALKING VERSION of DATE\s BOOK: An Introduction to Database Systems Wants you to learn the BIG ideas. easy class, no need worry about the quiz and midterms, he will keep giving the same questions until everyone knows the answer, today in my last midterm, the fire drill went off 20mins before the end of class. Dr Lin then said: Hand in, I will grade as it is. Students:It\s not fair!. Lin:Yes it is! you all had the same amount of time!     NOW, w, I took his operating system class and he is worst teach ive ever had! The guy is LAZY. He has students prepare lecture notes for him. All homework revolves around creating lecture notes for his future use., You know how youre supposed to learn something before being tested. Well, this teacher tests you first then teaches you after. And his grading, after the second time taking him, it is a mystery., He asks students to write lecture notes for his lecture. Although he doesnt cover any topic, he gives quiz every week., many great assigments but not clear., I learned nothing in his class....so I have to take him again in CS157B... still learning nothing, quiz/exam questions reused over and over again but STILL full of errors; forgetful; mysterious grading system (you think you know, but when grades come out, you realize you dont!!); knowledgeable in the field with no doubt, horrible, pathetic, does not teach anything.. gives random grades... worst professor i have had.. does not remeber what he tells students and then screws up things!, very bad professor.  He didnt teach anything!I wonder why SJSU hired this professor!, You wont learn anything in his class. In addition, he made tons of mistakes on quizzes and midterms, plus you might have to argue to prove that your point is correct., His accent is BAD. Hes been in the US for like 10 years and still cant speak! Dont think he knows much of the material either., Nightmarish. Student teacher taught many of his courses, in fact. Absolutely unclear explanations. Tested same material from 3-8 times depending. Impatient, unhelpful. Class grade averaged 60% (bumped to 80% due to his unique curve at the end., if u want to learn anyting!dont take his class!If u want get good grades and learn by urself, hes the one!, He tests you on complex topics, after giving a poor explanation of them. Then he tests you on the same things 5 or 6 more times. You have to really not be paying attention to not get near perfect scores on later exams., Dont learn much, but keeps you updated with technology and research., any person on earth can teach better than him., cant learn anyting, useless, cant teach, suggest find another job."
Jon Pearce,/professor/243000,3.4,26%,3.8,"Prof Pearce is a very eloquent lecturer, and his assignments and assessments are very relevant to the foundation of the class. However, he expects a lot from his students and doesnt respond to emails on time, and his final exam might take over class time (fair warning). Try to come to his class prepared., Wow where do I even begin. This is straight up the worst professor Ive ever had at SJSU. Please do yourself a favor and ignore all the good reviews here, he might even have made them himself. Super difficult projects/tests, unclear instructions, super harsh grading, very poor communicator, extremely boring lectures and personality, to name a few., Professor Pearce is very knowledgeable and all his lectures are on a website. Instructions are sometimes unclear but overall his class and coding projects are fun. He is also approachable and helpful so going to him for any doubts is highly recommended. There are 6 assignments and tests are just like the assignments., Professor Pearces lectures arent the clearest, but accompanying them with other online resources should be enough to understand. Grades are based on projects and he supplies most of the code. Final was easier than the midterm, but they both shouldnt be too bad as theyre based on the projects done in class. Nice and helpful outside class., Lectures are an absolute drag, much easier to just read the lecture pages on his website.\n\nNo curves and professor doesnt help to code review programs before/after you submit them so its hard to get an A if you make minor mistakes all the time and/or you do poorly on a midterm/final, but passing this class is pretty easy IMO., Jedi is a very hard project for the limited guidance he gives. That being said, this is the perfect class to take if you want to get into Compilers later on. His class will push you to understand interpreters very well, and he knows his stuff. Expect a lot of independent study., Doesnt have very realistic expectations for exams and grades difficult. Talks very fast in lectures and is difficult to learn from., He does not know how to teach, makes everything sound confusing, and does not grade fairly either. Grading is super tough, making it difficult to pass., He is not a very good teacher and his hw is way more harder than what he talks about in class. His grading is hard too and the effort you have to put outside of class is a lot. Avoid if possible., Everything was just bad. Grading criteria is unclear. He teaches the class, but that does not make him become a good teacher. I hope these words explain something. Overall, 1/10, I do not recommend this class., Avoid this class at all costs. Unclear grading criteria, boring lectures, and useless material. Nothing in this class is good., Yea, the new language is hard, but as long as you know what youre doing, all will be well. the midterm is all homework, know what you should, and youll do fine. time goes by quick tho. some hws are a bit tough but office hours should help, -Yes lectures are long ( YT /user/profjpearce/videos), but it helped me to watch the recordings over a few times rather than attending live. -Yes Jedi is difficult (custom built on top of Scala) -Exams are REALLY difficult and due to the weighting, worth a LOT -Recordings def helped w Jedi (being able to see his code) -Answers emailed Qs thoroughly, Professor Pearce is a nice guy, but he didnt do well transitioning online due to COVID-19. His lectures were long and boring, which was hard to deal with online. I feel like I didnt learn anything from his class. Do not take his class if you are not good at teaching yourself the lessons., He doesnt curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution, Throughout my 4 years at SJSU, this class with Professor Pearce wins the award for teaching me the most amount of useless crap. SWE majors, there are much better technical electives you can take that will actually help you land a job in the real world- unlike the useless crap taught here., If you\re looking to waste your time and learn irrelevant knowledge to the industry, this is your guy. If you are a SWE major at SJSU, do not take this professor! Homework is long, he nitpicks grading exam answers, and his material is just outright useless. He teaches you Jedi his own made up language that you will never use in the real world., The professor is awesome. Make sure to pay attention to every detail in class because he will go over most of what to do on assignments and exams, and those things are not easy. Do your best to get help during his office hours., This class really helped improve my coding design thinking. Challenging but you will truly learn a lot as long as you stay engaged! Hes a fair grader -- he does reiterate what he looks for on exams and homework; you just need to keep your ears open and take note of them. Assignments are interesting/fun! Super helpful during OH. Would take again., He is a nice guy, a great lecturer, gives great feedbacks during office hours. He is a tough grader, and I cannot stress how tough he grades on exams. He nitpicks solutions that are not identical to his, and he does not give partial credit. If youre looking to learn, hes the man. If youre looking to pass, try another professor., The difficulty level in this class skyrockets after the first midterm. You will be quickly overwhelmed if you start to slack off in this class when you start getting into the semester project. Midterm was easy, final was extremely difficult., Pretty easy class. Few, but simple assignments and a final project at the end which is also fairly simple. He goes over and does part of the homeworks. Tests are open laptop/notes and consist of 3-4 questions similar to the homework but slightly more difficult. If you found CS151 easy, then youll probably feel the same about this class., Few but important assignments. He goes over the homework in class very often, and would also often give away parts of the solution to the said homework. From the hints, one can often use it as a template and easily complete other parts of the homework. The final three assignments build on top of each other, would give excellent feedback if asked., His class is not for average CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you\re forced to take him, Good Luck!, Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard, Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can., Funny guy, makes lot of star wars jokes but wouldnt take his class again. Exams are too hard and labs are very time consuming.  I wouldnt recommend him, unless you have a friend who took that class before and could provide with you with previous term questions(which most of students in my class had)., This course is good. you will learn many thins about Object Oriented programming out of it. There will a project work and midterm and fnal., He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really wont help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct, His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times., Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit., Hardest grader Ive ever seen. The handful of people who camp out in his office seem to be the only ones with As. No matter how hard you try on the homework, unless you go to his office and get him to review it before submitting you will get an F. He is a good lecturer, but no way I would take him again., He is one of the best teacher at San Jose State University. His notes n lectures are very clear and he is very approachable. U have to work HARD for his assignments n project but you will learn a lot. I love UML diagrams after taking his course.I am really glad I took his subject., Dr. Pear is truly one of best teachers of CS Depart. His lectures are interesting and helpful. I loved UML after taking his class. Midterms and final are not easy, but his grading is very fair., One of the best CS professors at SJSU. Be prepared to do some hard work on the homework assignments. They are challenging but help you learn a lot! Fair tests if you have done hw assignments. If you are engaged you will learn a lot from him!, Hes not easy, but he is fair. the best prof Ive had so far at SJSU for CS. His tests reflect his lectures. The labs are hard as are his tests. If you can do the labs, youll have no problem with the tests. Helps those that want help. Perfect English (not a common trait in SJSU). Overall, Id highly recommend him, but be prepared to do some work., Very harsh grader. There is a good chance you will fall asleep in his class. If you do take his class - attend his exam prep sessions and write down every word - he will tell you exactly what would be on the exam., Extremly strong lecturer and funny person. look http://www.travelblog.org/Bloggers/Dr--Jon/ :), very difficult on exams and programmings. each program builts onto the next. if you cannot do the first one, you are doomed for the rest of the semester. classes can be boring at times., No Comments, Nice guy. Lectures are clear and easy to follow. No text required since its all on website (he dumbs the material down a bit). If you just read his notes & attend lectures, he almost gives the answers away to prog. assigs. These are worth high percentage of class (50%). Grader very lazy and took forever returning stuff, though., No Comments, knows language theory inside out . very systematic and well planned out . hw is challenging but also very interesting - u build a language ! exams are tough but dont kill you . good sense of humor and very helpful . take him if you can ., One of the best teacher in SJSU. You will learn a lot from him. After taking this class, youll have a very strong foundation to start a real life job as a web developer. Hope he will cover PHP in the future., cool guy :), The best teacher Ive ever had. Very clear + very helpful + very reasonable. His CS174 class is the best of the best (easily beat Stanford or UCB).  I knocked out many MS guys and got highly paid job last year with the knowledge I learned from his CS174 class., Great at explaining the subject. Makes the class interesting and straightforward. Grades programs easy, but grades exams hard., Look no further for CS152 . He has a Phd in a related area and knows his stuff inside out . His teaching is super clear not to mention excellent class notes , good help with assignments , patience and friendliness ., His programming assignments are the most difficult part of his class, they take a long time overall so start early! His tests will be based primarily on hints and homework. He also has a cool surfer accent. Riding a wave of functions man!, Ive taken several of his classes and he is easily on of the best professors in CS. Extremely knowledgable and approachable. His lectures are clear and he makes complex subjects easy to learn., Excellent lecturer. Very, very knowledgable., A very cool professor and knows his stuff very well. Everything is clear in his class and I learn a lot. His classes are not easy but as long as you put effort on it, you should get a good grade.  The best teacher in our cs department, Dont take him if you want to learn anything other than UML.  Nice guy, but not challenging., Clear lectures but hard midterm nonetheless. The final however is doable. Whatever it is, this teacher is great and I would recommend him to anyone who doesnt like to purchase an expensive book and read from it., Boring as hell; the people who get As in this class cheat. I know because I sat in the back during the final and saw so much cheating going on., Gives the clearest lectures Ive listened to in my 4 years at San Jose State. Expect to EARN your grade. Not the easiest teacher but you will learn a lot. Probably the coolest teacher on campus., Very cool guy, fun to listen to lectures and teachers material very well.  Programs are very hard though, as are exams.  One of the best teachers on campus., His assignments and tests are hard. But he knows his stuff, and his lectures are super clear. If you put effort into the class you will do well. One of the most helpful classes Ive ever had., Youll definitely become a better programmer after taking his class, but you might have to work hard for it(info for the avg programmer)."
Nadine Ferguson,/professor/2490513,3.4,59%,3.6,"The course is very lecture heavy, and are often monotonous. She doesnt respond or improve upon the class given feedback, and her class grades are often in the 70s and 80s on average for a beginner class. And some of these students have had additional programming experience. I would not recommend., I liked the class structure. I appreciated how quizzes focus on writing programs. Personally, assignments were time consuming, I learned a lot from them. Extra credit opportunities available! Professor Ferguson is helpful through email and weekly office hours. Put in the work, and youll get a solid Python foundation and a good grade., I took CS22A as an elective to learn the basics of Python. Lecture recordings are not posted, so attendance is mandatory. Professor Ferguson does a great job explaining concepts in class and is very considerate toward her students. She may appear strict and intimidating at first, but dont be afraid to reach out. Difficult class, so ask questions!, It is not an ez class but professor Ferguson is very good at explaining the materials. If you have questions, come to her office hours and she could spend even the whole afternoon/morning to explain it to you. But you have to study hard and understand the materials in order to get an A. I will retake her if I need more Python classes., There is only 1 assignment every week. No projects. We only had 1 quiz throughout the entire semester. There is a book for her class, but she provides a free PDF version. She is receptive to feedback and does listen to her students suggestions if reasonable. She is strict about following her structure for coding. I learned a lot in this class., Yes, the course is intended to be an entry level course to get your toes into coding, but I believe she does a lot more than that. She explains concepts very well and is also always easily approachable whether through email or her weekly office hours. I feel prepared to produce python code in the field due to her class structure., Beware of phrasing when critiquing her teaching/HW/tests. She takes them as a personal attack and acts accordingly. Easy A if you swallow your pride and follow all the rules. If youre having a hard time with CS you should take this class because its 90% rules, and 10% computer science., Not only she doesnt teach good, but also her assignments are nothing like those in class. She also grades unfairly. It is lower division class but she managed to make it lik upper class, python has never seemed so difficult. All those comments about other instructor is true, its pointless to hope she can teach. Money wasted on this talentless prof, Im sorry you feel that way. Every assignment is designed to enforce concepts covered in class. Programming examples/helper code is provided for students to use to complete assignments. My grading policy is laid out in detail in the syllabus. 3 unit programming courses require a time commitment of 9 hours of studying and completing assignments., You will learn more about acting in front of a camera than actual programming. Save yourself the headache and wait for other instructors to teach the course. This was supposed to be a beginner python class but was more of a theater class. Ridiculous requirements for homework that are not coding related., Demonstrating solving assignment problems has nothing to do with acting/theater. It is intended to show that students can explain the work they\re submitting for algorithms and programs they create and is a deterrent against submitting someone else\s work. One of the important skills in programming is to be able to explain the code you develop., If it werent for this class being a major requirement, I would never have taken the chance on taking this professor. So many hoops to jump through just to turn in homework of which she doesnt give enough time for especially during these COVID times. If you dont need to take this class immediately in order to graduate, wait another semester!, Students get 5 days to complete assignments in this class. For students who have extraordinary or pandemic-related situations, there are accommodations that can be discussed with the instructor., Dr. Ferguson was very understanding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only did she give extra credit, she let us redo our midterm to improve our grade -- thats unheard of. She goes above & beyond to support students, adjusts the pace of the class to students needs, engages students during class rather than lectures at them. Quality professor., Professor Ferguson is patient and genuinely wants her students to succeed in this class. If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties, she is always willing to help you out. She cares about your work and efforts. But all the exams and tests are proctored by Proctorio, which could cause lots of extra pressures., Just the worst. Save yourself a semester of headaches and heartaches and heed the advice of others before you and dont take her class. The worst university experience is in store for you if you must. Berates and embaresses students in front of others, extremely unforgiving with grades, and inefficient teaching methods., Baseless, blanked accusations are unhelpful for other students, so do your fellow students a favor by giving specifics instead of smearing a professor. Its unfortunate that some students use this platform for venting versus providing meaningful information to help others. My teaching speaks for itself., Please, please do yourself a favor and dont take this class! If you are completely unfamiliar with Python, this is not the course for you. She nitpicks all work and docks points for minor mistakes. Tests and quizzes are proctored only adding to stress and will be flagged for minor issues. Office hours are held before the weeks homework is even out, I wish I would have listened to these reviews. Please do not take her unless you need the class to graduate and there is no one else. She is a nice person and willing to help if you can make it to her inconvenient office hours. Lectures are long. No time for questions. Go over class time. Expect everyone to know python. Do Not Take Her Class!!!!, To clarify any misinformation, no Python knowledge is assumed for this beginner course, demonstrated by the fact that the course starts with basics like installing Python, writing basic one-liner programs, learning what a variable is, etc. The option of scheduling office hours by appointment is available if the set office hours are inconvenient., Im projected to graduate after this term, but this class is putting me at risk of delaying that for another semester. It is the most difficult class I have taken in the whole of my university education. Not because the material is too difficult to understand, but because of the sheer amount of memorization that needs to be executed in perfection, I am sorry you feel that way. My goal is for every student to succeed in learning Python programming skills. The class is designed to be hands-on, applying programming methodology. Students are given helper code for the constructs that are needed to complete their work without any need for memorization. This is an applied computing class., Professor Nadine singles students out and there have been times where she acted unprofessionally. An example: She purposely misspelled a student\s name in an email because the student addressed her as Professor Nadine. She doesn\t allow you to use sources outside her class material, such as google, to look for help because that is cheating., This is a serious & unsubstantiated accusation. When did I act unprofessionally and when did I single out a student? I don\t single out. The common protocol is to address professors by last name. Only 1 current student addressed me by my first name in email & was respectfully asked to address me as Professor Ferguson. Googling code is cheating., do not take her! cant seek online help (considered cheating), wont upload her recorded lectures, assigns hw w/ portions due within an hr after class time, goes over time a LOT, docks points if you dont code to her liking, unapproachable & inconsiderate of anyones time as a student. makes COVID learning so much more stressful for no reason., She was willing to meet outside of class if you needed extra help. However, she is unreasonable when it comes to looking for outside sources for help. She considers that cheating. Her test procedures under COVID were ridiculous and just caused more stress., What was most impressive about Prof. Ferguson was that she really cares about her students success. She is so willing to help her students even after class. Very responsive and extremely patient. Once you take one class with her, you realize that she is experienced and knows the stuff. You will learn a lot about Python., In class shes not really the most helpful (may come across as blunt), but the second you reach out to her personally she is very generous about assignments. Its important to talk to her about any problems you may have, and if you dont know how to do an assignment just go to her during office hours and shell walk you through it., Extremely unfair to students who are trying to be more advanced. I already have experience in programming, but she tried to restrict us from not using anything we learned outside the course. I did well on all works/exams, but she always found a way to take your points off. I only miss 1 attendance, but somehow ended up with B, very funny!, I had no knowledge about coding before this class but it was doable. Labs in class are very helpful to learn Python. Professor Ferguson is really willing to help students. She is very approachable and understanding!, Professor Ferguson is easily approachable and friendly. Her lectures are precise, concise, and detailed. She did a great job of conducting the lectures despite the technicalities involved due to the COVID situation. I would highly recommend her class. Please keep it up., I come from a nontech background, I took Professor Fergusons class to see if I would enjoy programming or not and I must say, I made the right choice by choosing her class. She made sure every student in the class understood the concept and the assignments were helpful in clearing up the concepts even further. I would highly recommend her classes!, Professor Ferguson is not only knowledgeable about Python, but is extremely helpful and understanding as well. Honestly, if you go to class and work hard, she answers all the questions you may have and helps you actually learn the content. I really enjoyed her class! She truly wants the best for her students. If youre trying to learn, take her!, Labs are every class, so attendance is required. Her class is difficult so expect to work hard, but she will go out of her way to set you up for success as long as you communicate with her. She truly cares and wants her students to do their best. My advice for you is to ask her to do examples when she lectures, cuz her slides arent always clear., Professor was really terrible with the transition to the online learning format. Exams are lockdown with webcam and she reviews the environment check harshly. Coding is great and all but she makes me absolutely hate this class and subject. Barely gave any extensions or buffer with the COVID matters per student. Has ton of attitude. dont take her., As a student with 2 years of Python development experience, I took this class just for prerequisites, and her class was completely BAD. Her explanation of how to use Python is difficult for most students to understand. She could not explain what her homework meant, because the introduction was confusing. DO NOT TAKE IF U WANT TO LEARN!, Professor Ferguson cares about the students & wants to make sure they understand Python. She is available outside class for clarification and is open to questions. Overall she wants to help anyone who wants to put in the work. This is a class where you will learn Python & can get a good grade. You just need to do all the work and stay on top of it, Professor Ferguson is a strict teacher you have to put in the work to pass her class. Otherwise she is considerate of the students as she was very understanding of my situation during Covid19. My advice is that you have to at least communicate with her if you have any issues. The class almost is like a coding boot camp., one of the worst professor i ever took. she doesnt clarify. lack of knowledge! not deserve to be computer science student!, It would be helpful to me and to other viewers if you provide an example of an instance where things were not clear to you.  It would also be helpful to be specific about what you base your statement of lack of knowledge on.  It\s easy to bash/smear instructors but it is more effective to talk to them about your issue to be addressed -- and fair!, This is by far one of my worst class experiences at SJSU. The professor is extraordinarily unprofessional in the way she conducts her class. Class work is difficult and she doesnt explain it well. During quarantine, her exam was lockdown with webcam and any noise triggered would mean automatic 0s. The transition from in class to online was bad., No one has received a 0 because of noise triggered flags! Its important to get your facts straight before posting false information.  Give specific examples of conduct that you object to? I think its disrespectful and unprofessional to bash the instructor without any basis/facts. Students who listen and participate have no problem in this class., Professor Ferguson is one of the best professors Ive had. She is warm, welcoming and puts her whole heart into her course. She structures the course to maximize learning through both lecture and hands-on practice. Opportunity for improvement through extra credits. Pay attention to lectures and youd do fine. Wish I could take more classes with her, One of my favorite professors ive had. She is very kind and great at articulating explanations for people who have no code background. As an EE this class made more inclined to better my coding skills outside of class and Im considering taking another CS course thanks to her amazing teaching abilities and patience. Wish she taught data structures, She does her best to accommodate to her students learning styles if you let her know ahead of time. Goes fast during her lectures, due to the limited time she has, but you can request for her to upload the lecture slides onto Canvas after class. Overall, attend all the lectures, ask questions and read the material ahead of time and youll do well., Wonderful professor. I did not have any background knowledge about both programming and biology, and was worried at the beginning. She helps a lot and really cares about her students to be successful. She is very flexible and generous. Attendance is very key to succeed in her class and ask question. She also gave a lot of extra credits., I loved taking CS22A with Professor Ferguson. She really cares about the class and that students really learn the material. She always makes time after class to help students with their questions so take advantage of that! Her classes are fun, and Id 100% recommend this class. Good programming class to non-CS majors. I wish she taught CS22B., Professor Ferguson has been such a tremendous help throughout my time within her class. If you are struggling, please let her know, because she is always willing to provide her students with the necessary tools to succeed. She cares a lot for her students and has stayed late on numerous occasions to make sure that they understand programming., Since there is a lab for almost every class meeting, attendance is important. Thou she is flexible and understanding for students with a valid reason. Very patient and kind. She would stay with students late, voluntarily. Very grateful., Profs section is extremely popular. I almost couldnt get in. Shes willing to take questions and repeats the concept as many times as students want to until the class understands. Though she has both in-class lab and HW that can be overwhelming but its for the benefit of students. i wish shed have the presentation avail online so i can catch up, Shout out to Professor Ferguson! She is an awesome teacher and she really does set you up well I went on to my other classes advanced and the pressure she puts on you makes everything else seem so easy after! She is awesome just do not cheat and work hard and youll pass! SHOUT OUT to Ferguson! I took her for 118, She was fine until she accused a couple of students of cheating in front of the whole class. She also projected one of their exam grades for everyone to see. Pretty sure thats not legal. Shes alright until she doesnt like you and then she gets super defensive and unprofessional. No electronics, labs due same day, keeps you over sometimes., Dr. Ferguson is extremely passionate about her students. She makes herself as available as she can. She will give you all the tools you need to succeed in her class. Her lectures are really good and referred to the book seldomly. Shes extremely fair but also holds you responsible for yourself. She absolutely does not tolerate plagiarism!, This professor is very flexible, goes out of her way to help students learn. Does not tolerate any plagiarism, makes it very clear starting the first day. If you ask for help she is more than willing to help you. Expects students to explain their code/algorithm to make sure they learn programming skills. Class is very organized., -singles out students in front of the whole class -has made her students cry -cuts you off -unprofessional and responds emotionally -no electronics -unresponsive to emails -extremely disorganized -often goes over time but glares at you if you leave when class is over -assignments are due that same day, but, can be flexible if you speak up about"
Philip Heller,/professor/2129477,4.1,77%,2.8,"Pop quizzes that dont count for much of the grade, 2 difficult lecture based tests + 1 group project for final, the group project is 100% if you show effort/energy even if code/content doesnt work. Just dont use your phone in class or type loudly otherwise professor might note you being off topic, Hes very arrogant in general and is very passive-aggressive when talking to him so it made it hard for me to want to ask questions from him. He tells us not to plagiarize his definitions but on exams, the right answer is his exact words. I didnt learn much from both CS or Bio sides of bioinfo and I would never want to take his class ever again., Lectures OK bit wastes lots of time with irrelevant stories. He thinks these stories makes us more interested, but in reality it distracts from focusing on the concepts. Can be rude on email. Not recommended, This man should be a storyteller, not a professor teaching computer science. Spent 65 out of 75 minutes telling some convoluted, confusing story and briefly tying it to a concept before ending class instead of directly teaching it. Rude and not open to questions to clarify whatever story he told that day. Try and take this class with someone else., Dr. Heller made CS concepts really easy to understand. Also, he would sometimes tell stories during lecture to keep us entertained. Homework and lab assignments applied lecture concepts. Exams were fair as long as you actually went to class and did the homework and labs. Really cool guy! Go to his office hours!, Philip Heller was great and inspiring to first-year CS students. Pay attention in lectures as he gives test question hints, and youll do fine if you make an effort to attend SI sessions., The guy is funny nice, but cant teach the concepts. He loves Java, but that is all about it. You cant teach based on your emotions toward Java :) Difficult Exams, Dr. Heller is such a rare find. He really wants to get to know his students and fuel their passions. When I was stuck on homework, all it took was an office visit for that ah-ha! moment. Teaches with lots of metaphor and humor, take him if that style helps you remember. Make the effort to be seen and remembered, and he\ll have your back., He made CS concepts really easy to understand. Also, he would sometimes tell stories during lecture to keep us entertained. Homework and lab assignments applied lecture concepts. Exams were fair as long as you actually went to class and did the homework and labs. Really cool guy! Go to his office hours!, Heller was a solid teacher. Homework assignments and labs are appropriately spaced out and helped me the most with understanding the course material. I slumped a little at the end and got an A- because of that, but if you consistently put in a moderate level of effort you will get an A., Extremely Condescending. Repeatedly makes it difficult to ask questions without getting a lackluster answer at best ( and dodges half the questions asked). Teaching method is almost entirely based on using irrelevant metaphors to help explain simple concepts rather than just going through actual code and explaining difficult material., Throughout the entirety of this semester, Professor Heller has been nothing but great to all of his student. He integrates pop culture references into his lectures to make sure no one is bored and will give us an inspirational speech now and then. He does his best to try and communicate to us and tries to answer as many questions as he can, If youve take Philip Heller, you know what Im talking about. The dude is a legend and hes like the random cool uncle of a family. Lectures had Star Wars references and he really is a good prof. Prepares you well for CS146 and the labs each week. The only caveat is that the green book exams on the tiny arm desks of big lecture halls sucks., I can see that Professor Heller tried to make his material interesting. If you focus on his lecture and review, always ask questions, do whatever you can accept those materials, you will be fine. The tests are really hard. I got 100 on the final because I read all of his lecture notes over 10 times before the test., Heller was ok, but I didnt think we was the best fit for me. The hw was fine, but I think he makes the exams harder than it needs to be. If you are more of a Java program, you should be fine. If you are more of a C++ or other CS programer then make sure you get very familiar with Java. He is a nice guy, but can be hard about his class rules., I am surprised by the high rate. Hes not for everyone. Not recommended., Professor Heller is one of the best professors at SJSU!! Amazing lectures, and assigns homework and labs that actually make sense. Midterms and finals are extremely straightforward, and he covers a lot of whats going to be on the exam in class. Id recommend you to go to classes just because they are engaging, but he posts everything online!, Prof Heller tests what he teaches. He even tells you what he will test on the final in lecture so write it down. His class is very well rounded and structured. He is fair in grading and is open to questions during class, something quite difficult in lecture halls. Stay after class if you want to ask a question though because office hours Is crowded, Had him for CS 46B and Biol 123B, hes great. Dude is magic, you literally dont realize how much youre learning until you look back on it because it feels so easy as youre learning it. Go to lecture and be attentive, you get an A. Simple as that pretty much. Lecture is not mandatory but is really helpful., Easy A. Take him. I didnt show up to class like ever because I was too busy studying for Phys 51. If youre not great at coding, you might need to show up and be engaged. Otherwise, just dont fall behind and youll be A1., Good professor, but did not seem like the best fit to teach a class of Bio and CS majors. He did not explain certain Biological concepts or CS concepts in depth so both students understood well, and his comments to students would sometimes come off as passive aggressive which was discouraging when asking questions. He was a fair grader though., Awesome professor, really inspirational guy that wants you to succeed. If you can take him for 46B you wont regret it. Love his Star Wars references and his lectures are never boring. If youre experienced at Java its an easy class, fairly challenging if youre a novice. Just dont be disrespectful or text in class and youll be good., Heller makes the class very very easy, as long as you show up and do the homework. there is a textbook, but you honestly wont use it. His exams are only on lecture material, so show up and pay attention. Beware that the homework is worth a LOT (40%) of your grade and it is easy to screw up submission, so be careful. Otherwise, very enjoyable class, THE GOAT OF CS AT SJSU, Should attend his lectures, reading his slides is sometimes just not enough. Prepares you well for the midterms and final. Be aware of the trick questions that he gives on his exams. He tells you which questions will be on the exam, write them down. Overall, a great professor., He doesnt take attendance, but if you dont go, youre screwed. If you actually pay attention in class and take some notes (optional, really), youll score an easy A. Also make sure you get 100 on all homework. He boosts the 1st midterm to the avg of (1st+2nd) if the 2nd was better. He can also be really rude so try to stay on his good side., Heller is really good at explaining things to someone in terms of someone who has never seen code. This class is really hard to fail (assuming you get 100%s on all your homeworks and at least 80s on your exams) due to the weighing. Heller is pretty lenient on grading, but if says hell dock you for doing something, he means it. Ovearall, very nice., He is a great professor. Its evident that he is very knowledgable and passionate about what he does. He really cares about his students and is always ready to help. His lectures are pretty entertaining and is always making jokes during class. He teaches concepts well and makes it easy to understand. 10/10 would recommend., His lectures helps us to understand how data structure is used in real-life situations. Amazing!!, One of the most passionate CS lecturers Ive come across. He really makes sure you can get the highest grade possible. Only gripe is that the class is honestly a bit too easy. It doesnt prepare you well for 146 with any professor. So I would recommend self learning on the side. Programming assignments were a joke. But overall hes a real nice guy!, His lectures help me to understand how the programming concepts applies to real-world problems, he makes the learning process very interesting, Lectures are well made and easy to follow. The homework and labs are helpful to learn from and will prepare you really well for the midterms and final. He knows what hes talking about and can answer basically any question thrown at him. Hes a fun teacher and tries to make his course as interesting as possible for the students., Awesome guy. Hes always optimistic about teaching and makes it fun. Really know his stuff. One of my favorite teachers by far., Boring lectures. Read slides., He is a good professor however, I didnt seem to enjoy his class. I didnt like his teaching style because he would show us code but wouldnt show us an problem and work through it with us. The homework is manageable and the exams are okay as long as you pay close attention in class., Best professor Ive ever had. Really wish he taught every single CS course because he was just amazing. Made every topic very clear and understandable. Highly recommend!, Dang this guy is the BOMB. Love his passion, his explanations, his openness. He really wants you to succeed. Curves the first midterm up based on your performance of the second midterm., This dudes pretty legit. You learn a lot of info in his class and he explains it so clearly. Homework also helps for understanding concepts taught in lecture. He was running out of time to cover homework towards the end of the semester, but he covered that info pretty in-depth in lectures. Highly recommend this guy for any CS class he teaches., My favorite professor at SJSU right now. I think it was his first year teaching here, but man he was good at it. Lectures can be a bit long, but the way he presents himself (charisma, confidence, knowledge, humor) and the way he teaches (explanations, assignments, experience) I really admire. He has this character that many professors dont have., Pretty easy compared to other professors. Do you homework and you should be fine because it is worth 35%. The class itself felt pretty easy so I was not really engaged for most of the semester. I got a B and didnt put half as much work as I put in 46A. Make sure to go to lab because most programming questions on tests come from there and homework., I can see Professor Heller already has some fans.. And for good reason. Hes awesome. After a shaky semester for the first Java class, I was skeptical to continue. But, this dude is the beeeeest. I swear, any class he teaches, Ill be there. Watching grass grow 102? Sign me up!, Very responsive to students, passionate about subject, patient with students, knowledgeable beyond programming, gives life/job advice, has a sense of humor, is very respectable/respectful, great at explaining tough concepts, very organized, strict/disciplined but polite/friendly, and overall a great person that actually wants students to succeed, First time teaching the course so it was a bit rough but he is a really nice and reasonable person and will definitely try his best to help you learn. Tests are moderately difficult. My main criticism: he tries to make his examples really relevant and related to the work he does which adds an unnecessary level of complexity for new programmers, This class cover some data structures but not enough., You can learn a lot of bio knowledge in the class. And the professor is very nice."
aaa aaa,/professor/1,2.6,34%,4.4,"I went into their class expecting nothing less from the first professor to ever exist. Very clear lectures and holds fifteen office hours a week. Slides are very polished but suffer from the slight drawback of being written in Middle English. Tests are easier than homework but harder than quizzes, exams, midterms, prison, finals, and homework., b, Is this a RMP easter egg?, Awesome teacher who really cares about making sure that you understand the material. Take him!, Really really great cares a lot about your grades and helping. You make clases so interesting.  One of my favorites classes., A woman gave you worst nightmare. Always writing the content of textbook in the blackboard but not teaching you. Never willing to answer question if you did not understand., This professor has a rotten soul. Tests are hard, not because of the content, but because she will take off major points for minor technicalities, correct answers that are too long, or simply because shes in a bad mood. Impossible to approach for help. Becomes irate at the slightest question. Mean mean woman., very mean professor., if you want an F take this teacher!, Shes really not that bad. Shes hard, but she will prepare you for work in industry. You need to take notes, and study the book. She gives extensive review notes before each exam, so students really have no excuse for getting a bad grade on the test. Shes actually a pretty good teacher. Dont listen to the lazy bums., Extremely HARD Teacher.. TERRIBLE Exams. HARDS Assignments.. Impossible to pass this class with her. She hard to approach. If u ask her a question & if that question happen to be from the prereq class she will drop u from the class. Ppl r scared of asking her questions for that reason. Believe me, Youll NOT pass in her class, Hence DONT TAKE HER., you have to memorize a lot of stuff. if you already know java/materials, you are fine., Make sure you know stuffs from her study guides for midterms n finals and you will be safe. hint: pay particular attention to points in the study guide that she mentions you must understand and those that are in bold fonts. For programs/project, make sure u meet ALL requirements. Lectures are bascially a re-read from lecture notes she posts online., Class is based more on the Java language than OOP. Test questions are extremely specific, so to get a decent test grade, you have to study *everything*.  Luckily she offers a study guide and her notes are online, so the book is mostly supplimental. Programs arent too bad, but shes a hard grader. An unusually high rate of failure for this class., Crazy.. possibly the only class students ever gona fail in SJSU are classes that taught by her. advoid at all cost., Shes not as bad as her reputation might suggest. The lectures are clear and easy to understand. However, shes not easily approachable, and being constantly late is a great way to get on her bad side. The exams are TERRIBLE because every little thing can be on the test, which makes preparation for the test far more stressful than it should be., It is a super easy class if you studied and memorized every word in the book and her lecture notes, otherwise, you are in hell.  Believe me, if you want to learn all the things by yourself, she is good choice, because she will force you to study by your own., Not an easy subject. She promptly returns students email for questions. If you put effort, you will get a good grade. You need to be more prepared with exams., Im not sure if she is human or robotic. She is NOT AT ALL approachable. She doesnt have ANY people skills. If you dont go to class, your grade will be (char)70 = F. Worst teacher I ever took a class with. JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER, In the beginning, you cannot tell if the teacher is good or not. Its after the 2nd hw that she gets ****y. Then the tests come and its memorization of CODE. She wont look at your code to see if its correct. She will yell at you for any question., not bad.. at the beginnin the course stress you out a little but soon obaid changed and a B wont be difficult, an A if you go to class., Very hard and mean teacher. I strognly recommend you not to take her class., Material is presented clearly (though mostly straight from the book).  Other than that I dont really have anything nice to say.  Stay on her good side, and hope you dont screw up.  Exams = memorization., No Comments, Pretty much look forward to hell. Ever heard of the term devil incarnate, well she is exactly that! We in class referred to her as hooch, as in Turner and Hooch! Expect her to fill you with every thing, asking you to memorize it, then only testing 5%., Obaid is a LEGEND in CS dept and everything people say about her is true! Shes very mean and difficult to get along with. Dont ask question unless you want to get insulted. Dont take her class unless you want to commit suicide., No Comments, Hard grader. Doesnt give much partial credit and very picky with programs. Shes not nice and insults you when you ask questions. Makes an easy class harder than it has to be., No Comments, No Comments, Few pass any of her classes. Strong temper, doesnt like people. Selects most pertinent material from many disparate sources, and presents it thouroughlly and concisely. Excellent assignments.  My lowest grade ever., In my many years of education I have met some sorry excuses for teachers and instructors. But I have never had a class be pure hell. The Beast Obaid is the meanest teacher Ive ever had. She takes a relatively simple topic Object Oriented Design and t, She is the WORST EVER! Seriously, she NEVER smiled once! She tried to make a joke once (without smilng of course), and it wasnt even funny! Shes MEAN and not helpful when it comes to learning the material. She also reads straight out of the book., Extremely Tough, Extremely MEAN.  Worst professor Ive had in the entire school.  DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES!, Doesnt address students questions well. Mean responses making students feel dumb., Evil computer science teaching robot who crushes humans for pleasure., i will vote for her if she were to enter the contest  Meanest teacher of the decade . I dont usually want to show up to her class just because i dont want her to remember my face. Horrible woman!!!, Cold COLD woman.  Shes not impossible, but shes to be avoided at all costs!, EVIL WOMAN! Only pass 2 out of 25 students!"
Natasha Bozovic,/professor/94609,2.7,N/A,4,"I retook this class, I had a different professor! I wish all professors were like her, she is by far really smart and very helpful. I took her online class and went to an office appt because i didnt understand anything at all she took the time, and i put the effort to learn what she was trying to teach., She is a really helpful, knowledgeable professor that cares about her students. Midterms are easier then homework, there is no limit on how many times you can retake them. Extra credit on homework and one midterm. Overall,  online class definitively manageable., It was a good class, somewhat hard, but learned a lot. Highly recommended., Hard class. My roommate was taking an inclass section with a different teacher at same time so Ive been able to compare them. Online section is a huge time sink, but a lot easier to pass. You can redo HW and quizzes for a good grade. Tests are hard but with a 100% HW/Quiz grade youve got a huge buffer., I am taking her online class and it is the hardest to pass. study all the time for Ds. She keeps moving the deadline for homework assignments. For written hw the directions ARE NOT clear on how to submit the assignment. DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS. TESTS ARE HARD, Took it online, pretty easy class. Make sure do all the hw. Midterm & final are based on the hw (similar questions)!, Shes got good intentions and cares about her students. Youll learn that through experience and her self-gratifying lectures., She was extremely helpful and considerate about deadlines. Might seem to be an easy class but have to know your stuff before midterm and final. No replicas of homework problems, work on getting the concept to nail the exams. She helps all she can and offers extra credit at the end too!, Dont be afraid to take her online finite class, especially if you know the material already. She was extremely helpful and accommodating, and I managed to pass even though I missed a few assignments. Just make arrangements ahead of time if your home computer is a Mac - she uses Windows software., Online class. She was very helpful, clear. B/c course was online, she extended our hw & quiz dates. On quizzes we were able to redue all of them. I liked her class. I didnt think she was a bad instructor at all..I suggest you do ALL hw & understand material b4 going into midterm and final., I dunno i tried hard in her online course.  I got bad grades on most everything but I think im still getting an A, She makes you work your a** off on homework (for only 20% of the grade) . not very clear in class. gives good notes . office hours arent too helpful .\n hard exams . all in all work hard for a low grade ., a bit hard but take her class if you want to learn and if you are planning to become a programmer, she doesnt teach you AT ALL. Take her only if you want to study 24/7 for this class. You have to study on yur own. Going to class does not help at all. I say take any1 except her., i dont understanding why she didnt get fire by the sjsu yet. i took her class two semesters ago like many students, i failed her class.. not just that, i also lost my pell grant $$ because of that. take her classes if you wanna torture yourself., Take her class if you got enough $$ and time to retake...Try Prof. Ng., Tough class if you dont study. otherwise its fine, some of the quiz and exam questions are straight from the book., Her classes were really challenging, but I liked them. I had both 46B and 146 with her. I chose to take her again for 146 coz even with a C from her you still have learned way more than other 46B/146 students who might have got Bs/As from other profs., This is a very difficult class.  I studied for eight straight hours for a midterm and got a D.  She knows what she is doing but she tends to put the things that were obscurely covered in lecture on the tests so if you have to take her, STUDY ALL OF IT!, I would not do it if I were you, it is a waist of time if you are an average B student, 25% of class quit before the end of semester, she got basically not enough., SHE IS EVIL. If satan spawned a daughter i would had rather taken her as a teacher.  When you ask her questions durring office hours she yells at you and accuses you of attacking her as a teacher. I have never had an F at SJSU before taking her class, She is a nightmare. Dont take her class. She make you feel that you are very stupid because everything supposed to be very easy. She dont know how to teach and she is very rude to ask her question! I never want to see her again!, DONT EVEN THINK about taking her classes. She dont know how to teach. Dont think about asking questions. She will yell at u as if you are the most stupid person on earth. Easy get F, Whoa nellie! Avoid Bozovic because you will have no time to copy her overheads and you will not understand every other word that comes out of her mouth.  I saw no difference between a midterm and a quiz in her class.  TAKE SOMEONE ELSE, even Lee!, I went through the entire semester expecting to retake this class.  I got lucky and had her also for 146 (Dropped).  I failed every quiz and midterm..  Well.. I got a D-/C+ on one midterm.. go figure.  I got a B in the class!  Avoid this one., dont let her ruin your career.. i will never ever take any of her class, even she became the only CS prof in the entire CS dept in SJSU !! unclear lecture, and midterms.. i suppose the finial too.. difficult HW.. plus not helpful outside class too.., she CANT TEACH!!!!! Brags about her daughters in college, but  they didnt have her as a teacher. She SUCKS!, A very difficult course. Dont expect to have enough time to finish her exams. Her quizes are not any shorter. But if you study hard, she will award you with an A., Dont take her! dont know how she grades!even though u have past exams and programs, shes going to make u suffer!, You have to suffer before learning.  She is not helpful at all.  She always wants to kick you out of her office, no matter how many questions you have to ask.  IF YOU ARE THE ONE WHO ALWAYS NEED THE INSTRUCTORS HELP, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS., She yells too much when you ask her a question. She needs to realize that this isnt first grade student she is lecturing. She grades really hard or at least her grader. I dont care but i wont recommend this class. I wish i never took her., hard to understand at times, chicken scratches for overheads, grades hard, A very knowledgable instructor who grades fairly and gives you what you deserve., She will make you work your a$$ off. You will learn more than you thought possible through blood sweat and tears., She sucks, uses the slides too much, and gives extremely long exams, Cant understand a word she says...., Knows her stuff, a bit harsh on the grading."
Paul Sanghera,/professor/89841,2.9,64%,3.4,"Professor Sanghera is the only one among my professors who, even in In-Person class, creates the online Course Forum in Canvas where students discuss concepts, problems, and help each other. He also answers the questions and posts very helpful material there. Easily available to help; before, in, after class, and during office hours, on the Forum.., I love the teaching style of this professor. He first explains concept(s) very clearly with examples, then dives into details, one step at a time. He makes the problems easy by breaking them up into fundamental pieces. You also learn the general methods of approaching, tackling, and solving the problems. Gives good feedback and cares for students., A long time back, I took courses from Dr. Paul Sanghera. I remember him as being very professional yet friendly with and respectful to the students. Beside course material, I also learned from his classes good industry habits: Professionalism, team spirit, code walking, comments your code, importance of deadlines. He connects courses to industry., Dr Sanghera cares about his students, treat them with respect.He gives lot, good, and timely feedback.He only scales grades on curve at the end of course.I loved his courses online forum that created for the class, even when the course was in-person.Any student can ask questions or answer them on the forum; he answer to too.He loves help students, Dr. Sanghera is always available, likes to help students. He explains in class what is not well explained in the book. Gives good feedback. He is friendly and respectful to the students. His quizzes may be tricky, sometime, but if you do your readings, you will do fine. I was lagging behind, he encourage and help me to catch up., Goes out of his way to help the students. I am an international student. He saved me one semester by helping me with the Registrars Office. Very friendly, but wants you to attend classes, do the readings, and do your homework. If you do that, you will do fine in his course. No free lunch. Gives very useful feedback. Dr. Sanghera care for students., As another student here said, I dont get it, all the complains here. All this Professor wants from us: do our part. I attended most classes,did my readings, and made an A. His lecture slides are very detailed. Most Questions in Quizzes, Midterm, and Final were straight from the slides. He gives good and lots of feedback. He care about his students, super, You have to work to earn to the grade is his class.  No free lunch. Dr. Paul Sanghera is very professional and fair his his students. He always like to help students, always available, gives lot of feedback. But he want you to do your share the the work...then you will be ok...and would not feel like bad mouth him like many complainers here..., A lot of people have been giving this professor a hard time and I dont get it. I agree sometimes it is hard to hear and understand what he is saying, but everything (hw, quizzes, exams) is taken almost word for word from the slide decks. If you just read those, its not a hard class., He is hard to understand at times in person, but he does care about his students. He opened a quiz for me just because I missed a class, but I was turning in all of my homework and wanted my grade to accurately show what I have learned. His quizzes and exams are taken straight from the slides, as long as you read those you will be good!, Please dont take him., The guy is ancient, not versed with technology. Check all of the positive reviews, they all have the same grammar mistakes, for all I know he himself made them. The guy seems to have some sort of problem speaking. Hes impossible to understand. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Withdraw if hes your only option! Even if you have to stay an extra semester!, He doesnt speak appropriate English which makes it very challenging to hear and understand. we asked for answers to our quizess and he refuses to give us any feedback.\nHe gave us a very hard midterm and a concept we never learned in class. the average of the midterm was 48 from 84 points. very horrible professor, the worst ever.\nHE IS SO BAD, Self-study class!!, Seems like a really smart guy, but Incomprehensible during lectures. Might have some sort of physical problem that stops him from speaking clearly, so its not his fault., he does not speak english, I have no idea how he was interviewed and accepted when he does not even speak English fluently. There are pop quizzes and also weekly quizzes in class. He does not reveal what questions we got wrong on quizzes so we have no way to learn from our mistakes. His instructions and replies on the discussion seem to be copied and pasted., I want all students to know that the good rating on his name is all fake, he does not speak English at all, you will not understand him, and he has pop quizzes in the first min of the class. he is not a good teacher, I would not take him if I was you., Take this professor AT ALL COSTS. You wont regret it, As others said: No Non-sense Professor. Very kind and helpful, but he want you to do your part of the job too: reading and trying the assignment., I took Computer Network course from Professor Sanghera in late 1990s when he was working on Netscape browser/server; he told us. He was first to include Internet (TCP/IP) into Computer Network course at SJSU. He caring, helpful, gave good feedback, easy to talk to. Self confident, not egoist. He inspired me to join Computer Network industry., Attend class is must. if you not, you will get lost in course. He fill gap in textbook, explain concepts and methods. Do extra things. Easily approachable. I was having personal problem effecting my grade. Instead of me approaching him, he reached out to me, to see if he could help. Very caring.  But make you work. no free lunch. HeThe best., very fair, friendly professional. easily accessible. very helpful. good feedback. course difficult if you dont do home work. very good lectures and slides...send lots of useful announcements in in-person course too. take part in discussion forum., His speech is barely understandable. I am not going to draw any conclusions of what causes it, but I will say that he ignores ALL SIGNS that his students cant understand him. He does not read the chat in Zoom, he refuses requests to turn on Closed Captioning, and ignores all indications of problems. Do NOT take him., Very frustrating teacher.  Extremely unprepared for lectures.  Just photocopied a chapter from the book and copied examples from it onto the board.  Very arbitrary about grading.  Very defensive when questioned.  Unable to explain some homework problems.  Great subject, bad teacher. :/, The worst prof. ever. I regret taking his class. Very unclear, boring and arrogant. You will get no help from him whatsoever. Good luck if you take any class with him. You will need lots of it., Very frustrating professor.  Past the midterm and he hasnt gone over new any material since 46B.  He cant explain anything in terms you can understand.  You are better off reading the book (the book is outdated also though) and learning on your own.  Gives very math driven assignments., He is pretty easy on grading. if you want the grade, take him, if you want to really learn something, take somebody else. Listen well in the class, his quizzes are base of his tests. You dont really have to read the book that much. He is extremely boring, ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzz.....oh is class over...., Youll have to learn a lot of the material on your own. Also, he never responds to your e-mail, so there is no point to ask for help in that manner. Finally, there is almost no point to go class, except for those surprise quizzes., Pop quizes require us to go to class, when all he does is read off his slides. I cant understand a word he says cause of his thick accent, and he bores me to death. He has a pretty long resume in the industry, and it makes me wonder why he is teaching., His lectures mainly consists of reading off the material from his slides. Very unorganized, meaning, teaches network programming and XML parsers before even touching JSP. Discusses hw on Mon, due Wed. Peers drop his class. and CHAIR, plz FIRE, Knowledgeable of the material. Lectures are ok. HWs are hard because he doesnt show you how to do them until after the HW. WTF!, arrogant, unclear on program requirements, two thumbs down"
William Andreopoulos,/professor/2534380,4.1,80%,3.2,"Boring lectures, but he knows his stuff, so pay attention if you can. However, I missed a lot of classes and it was sufficient to just self study the slides. Focus on assignments and youll learn/do well. A partner is allowed on assignments which is super helpful. No curve, but plenty ec opportunity to bump up a grade or two., This professor is beyond l .a. z. y. Has students in his class grade assignments for him, won\t respond to private emails because he claims that communicating online is a covid era thing, there\s a chance of losing points if you ask him to regrade something his graders made a mistake on, mumbles, reads off slides, and is always late to class., Basic shell/data wrangling stuff. HW is relevant and fair difficulty. Open book tests. Entirely online course. Participation quizzes are just 1% of the grade, so you can skip class just fine. Prof realized the grader was very lenient and lowered a few peoples grades after the final. But if you do the assignments properly you should be okay., Operating systems is fundamentally a hard course. With that being said, if you want to be able to learn through projects and assignments, this class is the class for you. Many opportunities to demonstrate mastery of the material through homework assignments, the exams dont weigh as much which is REALLY nice, if youre like me and suck at exams., Tests are 25% C questions that ask you what the program will do and 75% content. He gives plenty of hints of what the answer is, so if you dont know you can infer it. A bit monotone during lectures, but pay attention and you can learn something. Very nice guy whos accessible outside class, but dont ask dumb questions you can find yourself., This guy will respond to literally everyones discord questions at the speed of light but dont ask any dumb questions that you can answer yourself by reading the assignment or looking up yourself. Super caring and respectful and tests are open internet and all MCQ. He can be a bit monotonous during his lectures, but try your best to pay attention., If you wanna earn the big euros for your Mykonos trip, you need to learn C, and who better than the Greek God himself(William A). This dude responds to your questions faster than the new boyfriend your ex has just been with. The hws are a bit difficult but tests are not too complicated., Hes a top g. \nThe course content is good.\nExams are doable.\nLectures tend to be boring sometimes.\nHes pretty transformative, and excited to teach you new technologies: Google Cloud, IBM server, and AWS ML.\nC is not the only language he teaches, he also teaches Greek., Professor Andreopoulos is friendly and approachable for guidance. The class material is informative and well explained. if you understand the examples and concepts presented during lecture, youll do well on homework and exams. Youll learn intro programming in C for linux environment, threading, multiprocessing. It sounds harder than it is., The professor is always available. Very helpful slides and course material! He makes the topic easy to understand. Provides plenty of office hours.  Genuinely Cool Guy!, Good Professor! ALWAYS ALWAYS available for students. If you have some cool ideas, he is the guy to go to. He will help you in every way possible. Easily Accessible!, Hybrid class and zooms recorded so you can rewatch. This class requires you to work ahead as assignments take time to do. You can work with a partner if youd like. Tests arent hard as long as you study and they are materials from the slides. He gives clear explanations and could go over again if you ask. Extended the deadline a few times for HW., Bill is really great at teaching OS. He uses Zoom polling to keep everyone engaged, and the material from the slides is on the midterms and the final. The assignments can be difficult but you can work with a partner, so that makes it easier. Overall, if you are one of those people that works ahead, take his class, you wont regret it., Everything is very fair. Assignments are the most difficult part of class but his late work policy is very generous, and the later ones come with starter code. He mostly reads of the slides with a mundane voice, but the slides are extremely helpful and he will elaborate on questions. Material on the exams are all covered in the lecture slides., Really nice professor, responds on Discord quickly and answers questions in class, can attend the class through zoom or in person, hardest part was the assignments (worth the most), midterm and final seemed easier. Voice tends to be boring, would recommend typing notes in class during lecture to pay attention, Lectures were a little difficult to understand, and he mostly read off of the slides. However, his CS149 Discord server was really useful and he always did his best to assist students even on weekends. Just make sure to actually study (the textbook is pretty useful). Being an active participant in the class Discord gets you EC too., Professor is not able to speak properly, always mumbles and read slides. Did not show how to implement major data structures in Java like BFS, DFS, and others. Unorganized and does not present information in a professional manner. Quicksort trace took half an hour. He is unable to get students to learn due to poor pace. I recommend Attar or Taylor., You can watch his lectures thru zoom and he reads off from his slides but his slides provide good content. His HW requires coding around a concept he taught in class so I found it useful in learning the concepts. HW is not too hard nor too easy, but still challenges you to think. Overall, great professor. Would recommend to visit his office hours., Best 149 prof! Decent lectures that can get a bit boring but iClickers help. In-person class but you can attend over Zoom which most ppl did. Worksheets on intro to C and command line practice due every week and more challenging programming assignments due every 2 weeks. Fairly easy multiple choice exams that use Lockdown Browser w/ Webcam., Bill is one of the chillest professors Ive taken, highly recommend his class! Class was in-person but he would always record lectures so we can watch it from home without going to class. Extends many assignments and late work is barely penalized. Assignments not hard or easy, good difficulty. Tests are easy and multiple choice. Very caring guy!, Really great professor! He is always willing to answer questions, and I like how uses iclicker questions during lecture to check your knowledge in real time. He lets you form a group for a lot of work, so do that! Made a hard class that was hard really easy for me. Would definitely take again., I took Professor Bills class online due to COVID. He answers your questions right away and gives good feedback if you ask. The only problems I had with this class were that it was boring and I would zone out a lot because the professor would just read straight from the slides., He is a decent professor, his homework and exams were reasonable, and the iClicker questions (Zybook questions) helped summarize concepts. I think reading the textbook helped the most for the exams, which were mostly multiple choice questions. Easy to pass if you read the textbook and go over lectures., Will is a great guy. He could do a tad bit better on explaining concepts; however, hes decent as a professor. His voice is somewhat monotone and he takes a lot of these drastic pauses throughout lecture but I dont blame him for it., Fair warning, he speaks a bit slowly and can lowkey put you to sleep during lecture with the way he talks. He gives extra credit in the form of code reviews (people presenting their hw code). The online exams (COVID) werent that difficult. He will take the time to understand how his students think through problems and try to help them if they fail, His assignments & worksheets were similar to coding interviews. I know a couple of other students who got similar problem in the coding interview as he put on the assignments. Thus they could pass the coding interview in a breeze!... Assignments have clear grading criteria. Its possible to get a very good grade, as long as you do the work........., One of the best CS professors at SJSU and a really easy-going guy. His midterms and final are way easier comparing to his assignment given. If you spend enough time in his course, you can get a really good grade. 1% extra credit for your course grade if you are willing to do a code review each time. Assignments can be hard but doable., Hes a pretty good operating systems professor, however I felt like I had to a lot of self-studying to do the homework. Lectures were not too useful for assignments, however he does take late work which makes up for the discrepancies of the lectures. Overall lectures are bare minimum, a lot of self-studying which is ok., Great professor and passionate about the subject! Lectures can be a bit boring, but the implementation of iClicker questions keeps the class engaging. Very responsive and helpful via email. tests and C projects are not too difficult. The textbook (OSTEP) is also one of the most engaging and entertaining cs textbooks I have ever read., I took him for 146 too and I liked his class a lot. 149 is online midterms and finals. His questions are fair and exactly what he posts in his lectures. He is really helpful in office hours and gives extra credit. His lectures are a bit boring but he does try to make it more interesting also uses iclicker for attendance., Nice teacher, but lectures are almost useless. 90% of my learning came on my own time. A huge chunk of grade is from final (40%) which really makes the other assignments/midterms seem minuscule and puts a ton of pressure on final exam., Would go off topic during lecture and you really need to study outside of class if you want to pass. Took as an alternative to Patra but at least you know what to expect in Patras class. I had no clue what was happening most of the time., Great teacher in class, however most of the learning comes outside the class. Weight was 20% per 2 midterms, 20% homework, 40% final., Prof Bill is an easy grader and cares a lot about his students. If youre stuck and reach out to him, he will help you asap. The prob is, as this course is the most imp course in regards to interviews. I wouldnt really recommend him, most of the learning is done outside of the class. Take it if you want to pass, dont if you want to excel at CS."
Tahereh Arabghalizi,/professor/2926378,1.8,22%,4,"Harsh grader and cant explain anything. Horrible. Take with others. Avoid avoid avoid, Everyone did so poorly for midterm and final with no curve a 50 average for the class is so bad i cant believe it was not curved, mean for midterm was 48 and mean for final was 42. got a 83 on final grade went to 89 but extra credit and curve pushed it up to 97. lots of hw which is useless bc class was mostly stats with no actual python., Midterm average was 48, and final was 42. Tested on stats rather than python; midterm was identical to study guide and had fill in the blank codes. Pretty nice with questions. Every class was a lecture on a stats concept, barely touches on python concepts covered in Zybook. An A is doable w/o extracredit; didnt gain confidence with python., Didnt have an A until the very end when she applied an curve. Zybook heavy class. Mean for midterm was 56/100, and 53/100 for final. This class is way more heavy on statistics than python (hyp test, anova test, t test). Python portion is just doing statistical tests., Average on the midterm was 56 and 51 for the final. Assigns hw due either the day of the lecture or the day after. She assigns Zybooks which consists of like 400 questions per week which include concepts that weren\t even related to class. Exams are made trickier than the actual hw + lectures and are locked so u cant use it to help u., The professor does not teach at all, the Zybooks have to do nothing with the lecture. Often she assigns so much homework that we dont even use any of that knowledge anywhere, Absolutely disgusting how this class was conducted, changed grading criteria last week of the class and my grade dropped more than 4%. Joke of a class learned more statistics than python. Homework has absolutely nothing to do with in class lectures. Do not take., Horrible professor who can barely teach anything. You wont learn anything in her class, data science major and Im completely new to the world of coding. She doesnt make things easy. No personality, everything is so boring and she only reads off slides and doesnt elaborate on anything. Long homework assignments due on weekend. Overall, doesnt help learn the content of python at all. Got 72/100 on midterm, mean was 54, median was 60, dont take this class. Even if it is a weeder class, it does a horrible job of actually covering python concepts you need to know. Tahereh is only here to do research for the university or collect pay checks, her lectures are boring af and she obviously dosent have any passion for teaching. horrible experience for a freshman, Feels like a weeder class. Lectures are very long and boring; I slept through half of them. You can teach yourself the hour of lecture content in the ~20 minutes she gives at the end of class to do the hands-on assignment. We learn mostly stats in class but the homework is just python coding and its sometimes not even related to what we use., The lectures arent very engaging and come across as if shes tired of teaching. Doesnt seem she has any passion for teaching. Lectures are quite dull. Avoid if you can. You wont learn anything, Not that great. Do not recommend. She is caring and easy grader though., its more of a statistics class than a python class. lectures are all on slides and she just reads off of them. lots of homework and some of them are incredibly long (longest was 400+ questions) and sometimes it doesnt really matter to class. very helpful if you have a question though. midterm was exactly like the review., Lectures are not particularly engaging and she seems like shes tired of teaching, but they are effective in getting the material across and the homework is structured such that you will succeed on exams if you do it. Its clear that she wants everyone to pass, but again the lectures are really boring., I took her for 146 and 157A, she is a knowledgeable professor with clear lectures. Everything you need is on her slides. The workload is usually very short (30 min/week thats easy-med difficulty), however, the only downside of her class are the exams (med-hard). I attended lectures, prepared well, but I was humbled by the exams in both classes., assigned 7 hours of homework right before the midterm, I know python pretty good, couldnt follow along with her lectures.  54/100 average score on midterm, teached numpy,pandas,seaborn before loops. middle eastern accent (mild inconvenience). learned more statistics in this class than python or AP Stats. Class is huge, TAs were picky. dont. take., Failed more than half the class on the midterm., If there are 14,00,605 scenarios of you taking this class, there is 1 scenario where you end up liking this professor. While you are doing 7 hours of Zybooks over a few days you will feel your brain rotting inside. Ridiculous amount of statistics for a Python class but if you are a Data Science major its important. Take any other professor., I am terrible at coding and had never tried-- do NOT take this class if you are in the same position. Her lectures move fast and are very complicated. Tough class even for CS majors. If its not required, dont take her. If it is, just pay attention and keep up with her homework. And pray., This is a intro to python class but it feels like a statistics class. All we learn about is distributions, z-scores, and other variables that are related to stats. We hardly learn new python code. Assigns way to much hw to be done in a few days. Hw is even related to class at times. Lectures are boring and she doest provide depth to her lectures., worst teacher. If youre a data science major and shes the only prof available just go take it at the local community college... Im so serious, This is the most god awful class I am apart of. Midterms are coming up and nobody in class has any idea what is going on. She just reads the slides off the screen during the lecture in a monotone voice and does not provide any insight to her slides. She assigns 400 question homeworks  Homework is sometimes not even related to class., Do NOT take 22a with her, especially if you have never coded before. She will say this class is for new programmers but her lectures are horrible, lots of homework (sometimes irrelevant), and many statistics topics she will not explain enough at all. Lectures are also very dull and she doesnt even cover the curriculum in an intuitive order., 1) Tahehreh doesnt teach in class, she reads from a presentation. All real learning is done from homework. Quiz questions are vaguely worded sometimes.\n2) She gives too much homework after every class. \n3) One time she didnt stop the people leaving before taking the attendance. \n4) The exam was in-person, on lockdown browser, with the webcam on., Absolutely terrible. Firstly, this isn\t even a programming class. Its a math class according to Tahereh.\nShe doesn\t explain properly in class, only reads off slides. \nCan\t redo hands-on assignments if you make a mistake. (Why? They\re not test so just allow us to redo it). \nShe gave a 400 point assignment during the midterms week., Tahereh is alright. Most of their lectures are just her reading off the slides and its easy to dose off. The homework and project werent necessarily hard but its more self-learning than an official class. The final isnt as representative of the course content as it should be. If you cant learn outside of lecture, dont do it., Pretty good professor ngl, her slides sometimes covers alot of math and then sometimes not but shes very knowledgable on what she teaches, a little monotone but honestly better than a majority of the professors here so def a refresher., New PhD prof teaching CS. Offers helpful homework and quizzes for grade buffering, unlike others. Exams easy with lecture attendance and homework completion. Four programming tasks, concept-heavy course. Optional but useful textbook reading. Highly values office hours; gain back missed points on exam and programming assignments. Fair and engaging., First time prof, needs to practice lecturing, especially for first class section (monotone/boring). Rushes and squeezes too much material for certain lectures, but ends other lectures early because there is little material. Sometimes doesnt answer questions well. Only posts materials/assignments after the last class section. Weird due dates., I found it hard to follow the lectures, but the class isnt too bad. Midterm and final (non cumulative) were similar to the slides and hw assignments. Some had vague instructions. Gave extra credit for the final. Responded to me within a day. Midterm was heavy on theory but final was more about tracing algorithms. Recommend if you can self study., Professor Tahereh is a knowledgeable instructor who has a deep understanding of the subject matter. She is approachable and always willing to help students. Her lectures are well-structured and engaging, and she provide clear explanations of complex concepts. She is also responsive to emails and provides detailed feedback on assignments."
Melody Moh,/professor/355668,3.2,0%,3.2,"Put the computer science department down at SJSU. Very apathetic. Dont take her class. Dont explain well. We need a different department chair., Most Unprofessional staff ever in my life, doesn;t respond to emails, doesnt have any accountability, no responsibility, should be suspended for unprofessionalism, WHy are you the head of the department when you dont even reply to a single email? You were never available to any of us, I think it is high time you should resign for groos negligence, indifference, Such a shame I have to write things like irresponsible about you, i am just a student and even i cant tolerate your carelessness. Pathetic attitude, Interesting class and team project is really helpful to learn class subject., Ive taken CS158a/b & an elect. with Prof Moh. All required proj work along with textbook study. Lots of work, but its not difficult and the resulting knowledge is more valuable than reading a text.Prof Moh is very approachable & devotes a lot of time towards office hours-instead of grading papers with her office door locked.Inspiring&Supportive!, she is excellent in the field of networking. she is an angle., Had to take her again for networking, and she is just as lazy as before. We got some work back between 1 - 2 months after turning it in, but did not see the rest ever again. She will try to teach, and does know alot about networking, but ruins it by being very unclear and unorganized., Recommend for networking. Has a hard time explaining topics although she has a great deal of knowledge. Exams can be difficult, but are doable. If you have a good group, projects/homework/quizes increase grade. \n Very approachable and shows concern for the students. My main complaint is that she is lazy + takes too long to return papers and grades., Lots of work in the first week, but thats good so you get to drop before the drop date instead of after the first midterm which is always AFTER the drop date. Otherwise, if you can handle the first week, you will learn alot & dont worry, it eases up after the first week, but still lots of work load. Nice person, helpful, curves big time., Be prepared to do lots and lots of hardwork.This class has got three programming projects,two midterms,one final and quizzes&Homeworks spread out over the entire semester.One good thing about all this you get to learn the subject very well.Grading is very fair and she curves.Would i like to take 158B from her,absolutely., She is very knowledgable, but her teaching style just plain sucks. Learn mostly from the book and her exams are fairly hard. However she grades easy because she has a huge curve. She works and pushes us so much that at times, we just want to quit. Worked us harder than CS100W in my eyes., She has made me love the subject. I find her to be one of the most knowledgable teachers in the CS department and she really makes you learn all the important details in networking. Out of all the CS teachers Ive taken she is the best., What she teaches in class is clear, but her tests are way too hard. You can answer everything right and still get a C. Time moves quickly in this class, shes interesting., Very helpful~ Makes sure the class get 1/3 As, Bs, and Cs at the end, Very organized and provides lots of help with programs!, Kind and Compassionate Teacher.  The Projects will save your grade.  Has A LOT of good information.  Tests are retarted, you can never be sure what will apear on the test which is a problem because she only will ask 3 or 4 multi-part questions., Hate to say it because she is one of the nicest people ever, but her teaching style is ineffective. Tests and quizzes graded arbitrarily, tests on details instead of important concepts, class lectures often irrelevent. Same amount learned as self-reading., Extremely knowledgeable, you need to work VERY hard in this class, it is very tough, most suited if you are going to do research in this area.  If you are willing to learn she is the best teacher in the CS department, and one of the best in Networking"
Anna Shaverdian,/professor/2036421,3.8,67%,2.3,"Thank you Professor Shaverdian for being one of the only instructors that actually cares about your students. Amazing class, wasnt easy but I learned a ton. 100% recommend and would take again., Annas exams are hard and she does give constant homework but this class really helped me on my interviews.  After taking this class I got a job offer. She cares and knows most everyones names. Theres like 60 people in the class which says a lot., I learned nothing during her lectures. Only learned by doing the homework and studying on my own. You can answer exam question correctly and shell mark it down because it was not her answer. You can skip class but then shell complain about you not coming to class. She has to give extra credit just so that you even have interest to come to class., Shes a very engaging professor. She made a boring subject interesting. The class was a large lecture hall but it felt smaller. She is always really open to answering questions.  I think it was her first time teaching the class., I like Professor Shaverdian -- shes nice, approachable, & has an entertaining personality. Unfortunately, shes not great instructor. She reads directly from the slides & has difficulty answering students more challenging questions. She even agreed with a wrong answer given by another student. That said, it was almost impossible to not get an A., She just READS a PPT which is made by Professor Stamp. Her lecture is really boring. She accepts many students, and most of them did not show up because she just READS the PPT:(, Shes a good professor and helps you prepare for interviews. Choose a reliable partner for the projects as the projects are time consuming so it is necessary to communicate with partner. Tests can be hard.  Sometimes she gives pop quizzes in class. Have your basics clear if you want to do good in her class., One of the best CS classes Ive taken so far.  Challenging at times, but well worth the extra effort.  She was always well prepared for the lectures and was very knowledgeable., She sticks pretty rigidly to the slides in lectures, and sometimes stumbles when asked questions outside of the immediate slide, but is very willing to help and always trying to engage discussion from the class. Written homeworks were hit or miss, but I enjoyed coding hws and felt that they were challenging and applied material well. Grades easy!, best prof ive ever had. challenging class but you learn a lot!, class is about 45 min slides and 30 min practice problems. She sometimes uses interview questions, take her if you wanna get an A"
Mike Wood,/professor/2922737,5.0,100%,2.3,"Hes really nice and teaches very well. His slides are concise and helpful and you can tell hes passionate about what hes teaching. Overall the best CS professor Ive every had., Professor Mike Wood is a caring and respected professor, this course is challenging but manageable and informative, there is weekly homework and a lab as well as some reading assignments and participation points in class. I would recommend this class and professor because Mike Wood is very helpful and responsive. Take him., Loved CS46A with Mike Wood. Assignments can be time consuming, but lots of leniency and extra credit opportunities. Open note and code exams with a very helpful practice test provided. Very easy to get a good grade, would definitely recommend., Professor Mike Wood is a knowledgeable and caring Prof, he is honestly very chill and funny. His teaching style is effective and he gives good feedback as well as help if you go to his office hours, the class is hybrid, 2 midterms and one final, generous extra credit, his class is amazing but beware of the heavy course load it is a fast paced class, The professor is great and explains everything very clearly. Mid terms and final exams are tough but he gives review before exam. One of the best professors., CS122 was great with Professor Wood. He gave very clear, engaging lectures. He was accessible outside of class. The final projects were great. The midterm was a bit challenging with the time contraint but you could make up a lot with extra credits. Makes sure to do your assignment on time., GREAT PROFESSOR NO CAP. Uses lots of examples to demonstrate and help you understand a concept. Responds to the emails pretty fast. And he would be glad to answer any questions you may have patiently., Great guy, the best CS46A course at SJSU. He created tons of examples and participation assignments that were engaging and helped even people with no Java experience like myself get very familiar and confident with using the language. Exams were extremely straightforward, Canvas is always updated with resources, and grading criteria is super clear"
Feiling Jia,/professor/2019310,2.7,N/A,3.8,"Definitely not an easy professor in terms of homeworks and exams. He makes you earn your grade, but at the end of the semester you will know all the work you have done worth it. You will learn by doing the projects and of course the harder, they make you more ready. If you do work for homework you dont need to study too much for your exams., Honestly, one of the worst professors Ive had. He basically copies lectures from other professors. Doesnt contribute in the slightest. Directs all questions to other students. Grader does most of the work. Avoid, if you can!  1 Midterm and 1 Final. Homeworks are not worded correctly. I just hope I pass., This is the most unorganized class Ive taken. Not only does he not know the subject and questions, he redirects any questions to other students.  Participation is counts as a hefty part of your grade and its inconsistent with everyone in the end. Gives quizzes that dont even matter since thats his way of taking attendance., 55% Homework (6 x Questions + Programming in C), 15% Midterm, 25% Final, 5% Attendance. Grade is curved. Class is passable if you dont attend lectures. Jia makes all lecture materials available online. Exams are based far more on lecture materials than anything found in the textbook. Has accent but understandable.  Get there early for a seat!, Be sure to go to class if you dont like reading the textbook. His lectures can be quite long, but the grading isnt so bad. Just make sure you do well on the homework problem sets and dont hesitate to him any questions. He allows many of the homework to be done in groups, which is quite nice., I rank Feiling Jia over Juan Gomez easily. He has an accent, but his English is good, so hes ez to understand. Also pretty chill--kinda stingy about uploading his slides, but he eventually does. Interesting & doable programming hw in C on Linux using VirtualBox. Its somewhat easy to guess the exam qs if you skim the slides and written hw."
Ashish Khanchandani,/professor/2935012,5.0,100%,2.8,"Amazing man. Very passionate and inspirational. Always finds time to answer your questions., Great teaching style, he is that lucky professor you wind up with who you have no trouble understanding. The course itself is very light workload compared to other CS classes so you can take this one without stress. Just be organized and pay attention to the content and youll breeze through it. Easy, yet you actually learn things from the course., He is very enthusiastic about teaching and his area. Make sure to participate and ask questions, and you will pass the class while enjoying it., One of the few professors who actually care about your understanding and progress in the course. He is passionate about teaching and very reasonable with assignments and grading. Tests are all from the lectures so studying the powerpoint as well as attending class is and sure way of doing well in class., Ashish is possibly one of the best teachers I have had in my academic career. He is also a student so he understands the best way to teach us. He is a very lenient grader and both his assignments and tests are practical and fair no curveballs. He has a simple way of teaching that is easy to follow along. Overall he is the GOAT, 100/10 I recommend."
Tran Duc,/professor/2190897,2.3,25%,3.5,"This class wouldnt be so bad if we didnt have to run all our big data tasks locally. It just makes it a complete nightmare to get anything done on our weak machines.  As for the lectures, theyre okay, but the slides are really cluttered with information., Hes clear about what he expects from you in the class by setting a minimum standard but still giving the option to go further and explore for yourself. Learned from online Stanford lecture videos which gave a good basis, and the professor used the class time to focus on important topics for midterms and finals and job advice. Great Professor!, He will post your midterm score and assignment grades on google drive and the whole class can see it. 1 project, 1 midterm, 1 final. He doesnt teach anything in class, you will watch Stanford videos and do the homework and class time is for asking questions. He will randomly ask questions from homework to students in class.  He is ok., He does not explain materials well, and a midterm exam was really horrible. He does not care whether you are in the class or not since attendance is not mandatory. I do not learn anything from him. All he teaches in the class is to explain about online quizzes which come from assignments. Thats it!!!"
Auston Davis,/professor/2104782,3.0,34%,3.3,"The project was the most interesting part of the course. There are a variety of topics that you can choose from. The overall course is overreliant on the textbook by Professor Mark Stamp. We faced too many issues/errors related to questions in the quizzes and exams. The feedback from assignments/projects didnt truly reflect the effort put in., The professor simply reads the slides that have been prepared. There have been instances when he rushes through his own slides and completely changes the meaning of the concept. Too many heavy homework with no feedback on them. Gives full credit for all homework assignments even when students have written wrong answers. Doesnt check or read answer, This guys awesome, and hes very passionate about computer security! The course can be heavy early-on, but gets better slowly. His projects are interesting. Quizzes and exams are easy if you dont skip any class or any chapter. Many things on the quiz are usually what s discussed in class & generally cannot be found on his slides or in the book., Overall course structure is easy and worth taking."
James Casaletto,/professor/2071642,4.7,100%,2.7,"Nice course. Simple grading criteria. Easy to score, One of the best at SJSU. Non ambiguous lectures. Well prepared., I took Big Data subject under James Casaletto. He makes lectures super interesting. He is a born teacher. His grading criteria is also very clear. CS185C is a light course and contains the concepts of Hadoop, Hadoop ecosystem, Spark, Kafka and Machine learning basics & 2labs, midterm, final and project. Course is good for learning, grades and fun."
Punit Sundar,/professor/2592067,5.0,100%,2,"Professor Sundar really helped everyone learn things, and was understanding when someone needed more time or needed the pace of the class to slow down. She was open to extending due dates and giving extra credit for hard exam problems. Really great teacher, and I would definitely take again!, Would recommend you take her course! Super kind and caring professor. Coding is difficult but she guides you thru tons of examples and will always help you on your hw. She is always accessible for you to talk to her. Will always urge you to email for help & not to struggle on your own., This is her first time teaching but she is really knowledgeable and super helpful. She gives us lots of chances for extra credit and her lectures are super clear (might be fast sometimes but feel free to interrupt her if you have any questions). She is flexible with office hours and very approachable. My most favorite class!!!"
Michael McThrow,/professor/2655879,2.3,34%,4.3,"This is the best professor Ive ever met. He is always available in his long office hour and super patient. Ive seen more than three times that he just quickly finish his quick dinner and prepare to answer my questions.(guilty)He can explain things in an easy way. I admire his wisdom for life and teaching., This the WORST class I have ever taken in my entire undergraduate degree. Avoid at all cost, this guy has a main job that he spends all of his time on. He is very vague on what he expect and then grades extremely harshly. You will regret taking any of his classes, Very vague with his assignments. The lectures would kind of help but it was mostly up to the students to read and do the assignments on their own. The labs were relatively easy but the projects were insanely difficult as it would require a copious amount of time. Avoid at all cost."
Amith Belman,/professor/3039911,5.0,100%,2.7,"Dr. Belman is an amazing Professor, and this is also my first time writing an RMP review. He has amazing lectures, and he makes his lectures fun and interesting. Multiple HWs and 2 exams throughout the semester, not so difficult if you pay attention during the lectures. He is also pretty accessible outside of the class. Highly recommended!, Very engaging lectures and gets all the information across in a good manner. Hes very knowledgeable and great at answering questions. Homework is an interesting format, but prepares you for exams well; weekly in class quizzes, one midterm, and one final. Had fun learning!, Despite being a new professor here at San Jose State University Pf Belman exceeded my expectations and helped us incredibly in understanding course material. His Lectures are very detailed and as he is very attentive so he makes sure we all understand the lectures before moving on. As a person, he is very down to earth and friendly!"
Telvin Zhong,/professor/3048474,5.0,100%,3,"The material is well-prepared, and grading is based on group projects, a midterm, and a final. Tests are doable as long as you pay attention to the slides. I recommend doing homework after each week slides because it is related to the tests. Hes knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely cares about his students. Highly recommend!, One of the best professors Ive had. Exam and project heavy, but his class is fair. Good feedback, lectures, and no homework. Hes a young prof thats caring, relatable, and fun. Insightful and relevant content, he truly wants all students to do well. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this class, hes the GOAT., Amazing professor. His slides are very organized and he is good at explaining everything in a very understandable way in lecture. You can tell he is very passionate about teaching and cares to see his students succeed in class and also out of class. Exams are very close to the lecture materials so take good notes and go to class to do well."
Peter McGlaughlin,/professor/2984010,3.7,67%,3,"-> Clear grading criteria. \n-> Very informative slides and lectures. \n-> Would need to attend the lectures to develop understanding. (Highly recommend attending all lectures)\n-> Professor is always available during office hours to solve any doubts or explain concepts.\n-> Exam is conceptual so a good understanding of content is crucial., He has a great knowledge of the subject. His slides sometimes have typos but he acknowledges it (it is normal with the amount of work a first semester lecturer has to do). Office hours were great. My team progressed on the homework a lot and we were laughing all the time., He is generally a good person, but most of the time, he appears to be confused. The slides he uses in class contain inaccuracies, and although he acknowledges the errors and apologizes, it can make the material confusing. The grading system is fair and transparent."
Tsau Lin,/professor/2185484,3.5,50%,4.5,"Very unorganized, his lecture notes and set up for the project (?) are all kept in CS 157A repo. Slides are messy. All he talks about is C stuffs. Straight up dismissed my question for the project (even though I checked with my classmate later and got it right). Will try to update more as the semester goes on., Very unexpected teacher. you will have quiz our of no where. sometime more than 2 quiz in a day. So difficult to understand sometime he doesnt know what he is talking about. Very confusing. If you just want to pass the class he is great. you wouldnt learn much for the first half of the semester. Second half of the semester he go crazy on SQL."
John Pearce,/professor/2185466,3.0,50%,4,"I took his course in Fall 2019, he was a good instructor and his office hours were informative. A concern I agree with others is his ability to respond to emails. Lectures were dry but useful for doing projects and homework. His personality was approachable and friendly in my experience., He make jokes in middle of lecture. He knows his stuffs. EXAMS are extremely hard. In first midterm half of the class get F. But if you do good in final he will help you in your midterm. lectures are boring. most of the class dont even listen to his lectures."
Doug Case,/professor/3015141,5.0,100%,2.5,"Really good understanding professor. Made an otherwise really hard topic somewhat easier and fun to learn with his in class activities. Lectures can be dull at time but would usually always end with in class activities. Really made this course easier than other professors, Professor is good and course work is easy as compared to other professors for this class. He is willing to help you, class excercises were fun and great to learn algorithms. Only con was most of the grade is midterms and final, which were high scoring and was from his lecture slides. This means easy to pass, but not sure about A."
Suhas Chelian,/professor/3062472,5.0,100%,2.5,"Professor Chelian is fantastic. He has detailed lecture slides, provides thoughtful and helpful feedback on the milestones for the project, and cares about his students. He is receptive to student feedback and implements any suggestions right away, making him a good professor. He has a lot of solid industry experience and brings in guest lecturers!, Professor Suhas is an excellent instructor. The lecture notes are detailed and his exams reflect the content covered in class well. He gave extra credit assignments which helped a lot. He also included group projects with detailed instructions and helpful templates. However, releasing the project details a bit earlier would be even more beneficial."
Mohammad Masum,/professor/2875424,5.0,100%,3,"Considerate, has in depth knowledge about the subject. Helpful and approachable"
Guannan Liu,/professor/2978860,5.0,100%,3,"Prof. Lius data viz class was a revelation. Crystal-clear explanations and hands-on practice made complex concepts sing. We learned to craft data stories, not just charts. A must for anyone wanting to master this impactful field."

Debra Caires,/professor/244307,2.3,32%,3.7,"This class can be a bit disorganized, but with some effort and using helpful study tools like Unstuckstudy, you can get a lot out of it. The professor tends to ramble, but engaging with the material and assignments is key to success. Overall, manageable difficulty., The class is really two parts. The first 85% of the class is plain easy, it\s just a bunch of fake diatribes of her experience in the field and light busy work week to week. Then, she assigns the POC at the tail end of the course, and you need to do a couple of all-nighters writing a 50+ page document. So divide your time up carefully beforehand., The entire semester was spent telling irrelevant stories and barely working on the final portfolio, before practically giving up and just throwing the rest of the work at us. Final grammar exam is completely irrelevant to course content, and the entire Proof of Concept is mindless writing. Ignore her and get parts done on your own while she talks., Horrible class. Extremely easy--you literally just need to do your assignments and you will most likely get an A. Lots of fictional stories. She kept talking about how shes a recruiter at Verizon and then from Verizon it went to Yahoo and Boeing and just went on from there. The POC was 50+ pages for most people, and was an actual joke--busy work!, The first half of the class was super light while the second was packed with assignments. She rambles for an hour and doesnt teach anything useful while vaguely mentioning agile principles. This class has very little direction but a lot of assignments. She also lies a lot, so I wouldnt trust her career advice., Her fictional stories about her case experiences takes up most of her lectures. Gives a lot of assignments that will feel irrelevant to your major., This class is doable but super frustrating. Disorganized and has a lot of pointless assignments. My advice is to get the assignments done ASAP, especially the PoC. Always ask for clarification if youre confused, most likely other students are too. As others have said, take what she says with a grain of salt., I dont know how she still teaches; this class is a joke. Nothing is taught in this class. Spends most of her time talking about her nonexisting work experience. Be prepared to put a lot of time into doing HW and POC projects that will take days, if not weeks, to finish., A 20 page paper is required towards the end of the class. ChatGPT didnt exist at the time so the paper took up all my free time/was complete busy work. Theres a grammar exam at the end of the class but she doesnt teach anything grammar related. You also have to use Adobe XD to create an app. The class is way too much work with little guidance, I would advise students to stay away from her, but thats a little difficult given that shes the only teacher who teaches 100W on a regular basis. The class has too much work, and some of her advice should be taken with a grain of salt. The best thing she did for us was teach us how to structure our resumes, otherwise, it was not a helpful class., Debras course was poorly structured, and the Canvas assignments/posts from previous semesters made Canvas a nightmare. She copy & pastes assignment feedback for everyone. Nothing taught for the Grammar Final. Lectures were a negative experience due to disorganization, the participation format, and her disencouraging attitude toward students., While Debra, is a great professor, some of her career advice is to be taken with a grain of salt, that does not mean all of it is bad, just trust your gut than blindly following what she says. Other than that Debra is a decent professor, who makes times for her students, even though she has a busy life outside of being a professor., The canvas page for this class is designed to cause pain and suffering, with wildly incorrect due dates and poor instructions on assignments. Most assignments have no purpose except to waste time, and youll be called on at random to provide your thoughts on whatever she wasted the last 30 minutes doing. This will be your most stressful class., Take this class if you want to hear made-up stories and biased judgement. She told a student who had a LinkedIn profile picture with landscape background that this is bad because people would think you prefer to be outside rather than being indoor coding. Did you even realize how absurd this was? This class is nothing but a waste of time!, She told a student to take a LinkedIn assessment in front of 32 other people and told others to help him. Then she said that all 33 students were not ready for work since he did not pass. Firstly, that would be cheating if he passed. Secondly, dont lower your students self-esteem like that. Debra, if youre reading this, pls dont do this again!, It doesnt take a detective to realize her stories are made up (an engineer fainted since a project was changed? an offer given in parking lot?). Whatever she thinks will make you succeed is not true, at least not any more in a modern tech industry (trust me, I have 5 internships and a 200k new grad offer). Take her if you want to waste your time!, biased and usually gives bad advice. Her stories may trick those w/o experience, but if youre in the industry, youll know her methods are outdated. She made a student take a LinkedIn assessment in front of everyone and told them to help him. Thats CHEATING! In one section she says shes currently at Apple, in another she says Yahoo. What a joke, She is nice person. POC was long but we had a lot of time to do it. A lot of us got A-. Final was grammar test, but was not hard. It was long tho. Take it, do the assignments and you will get good grades. Its online., LOTS OF WRITING called POC (32 pages in total for me No Joke). Each quiz and even final test were not related to what we learned in class at all. No communication and no flexibility., Debra is generally a nice person and she cares about her students\ success. With that being said, her class was rather disorganized. We ended up not using Criterion for the final project (as she planned) because she gave us an invalid signup code. Also, the final portfolio isn\t particularly useful if you don\t have plans for entrepreneurship., This class was hell on earth. Forces students to turn on webcam during lecture - takes 1hr to explain something that could be done in 10 minutes. Leaves out critical instructions for presentations and final project. Doesnt reply to emails. Canvas page is messy; had multiple grading problems. Her career advice is actually detrimental to students., She claims to be accommodating/reasonable, but she is not at all. Nothing is due all semester & everything is squeezed into the last 2 weeks, busiest time for other classes. I didnt have a problem with her at first, but after we turn in the huge final project she blames us for not understanding her vague instructions. We dont have time for this!, We barely did anything that benefits CS students. Be prepared to pay (around $80) to access Pearsons MyLab. MyLab assignments were not related to the class. Be prepared for a lot of busy and unnecessary work. Be prepared for a POC document that it is a lot of useless work. Final exam is a grammar exam? This class is a gigantic waste of time., The worst experience ever. She gives you misleading and outdated career advices that wont help you get a job. Gives lots of meaningless writing assignments instead of polishing a resume (we spent 30 minutes on it in 18 weeks). Doesnt answer questions and talks off-topic too much. Final exam, which we didnt prepare at all, felt out of place. Bad., I felt less betrayed by my ex who cheated on me. I could barely study for my other courses because of how much work I had to do for her class. She constantly contradicts herself. To be fair, decent career advice but not the best. If theres another instructor, youve been dealt a royal flush take it., Don\t expect much good. Yeah, she has you work on a POC, wireframes, qualtrics, and other things, but she doesn\t understand their use. Her background seems to be in HR or something of the sort. She talks herself up. She doesn\t understand business, she just has a few trendy things she likes to teach (learned from a TED talk sometime probably)..., Poorly organized class, textbook homework felt irrelevant, final grammar exam had no build up and felt out of place, and class overall felt like a busy work. Kinda do nothing in the first half of semester, but then she throws the POC outta nowhere. Resume/LinkedIn building was nice, but thats the only positive for me. Class needs restructuring., You dont do anything for the 1st 1/2 of the semester, then youre thrown into POC + Prototype. Canvas page is an absolute mess. Pearson HW is unnecessary. Lectures are disorganized and chaotic, esp. on presentation days, but she thinks its fun for us. Questionable and biased grading system. Blames Canvas when she messes up the peer review system., Very bad course. She really didnt know how to teach this course. Every assignment she assigns is meaningless. At the end of the term is a 15-page paper. To be honest, every assignment she assigns is meaningless. She has always emphasized what is the manager wants to see. . . But She really has no idea what the current job market is like., What a terrible professor, you have to do a lot of meaningless tasks throughout. Just let you do it and wont teach you anything. There is no value, I would never choose her again. I hope she will be expelled from the supervisor and will never teach again. Also, you need to have a good team, because all ratings are team ratings., As a professor and person, I really liked Debra. Cares VERY deeply about the success of her students. Shes on East Coast but had office hours until 3am EST to help with POC. Learned lot about how industry works and get good advice for resume, etc. Felt Pearson HW was unnecessary, but wasnt due til last day. Appreciated her enthusiasm and care., Debra is passionate providing resources to students and teaching. She creates an immersive realistic industry setting in her course; any question that you have will be answered with real examples to substantiate it. After exposure in industry, I realized this course is essential for understanding how to be successful in SWE internships and beyond., I understand why people rate this professor poorly- but I really liked taking her. She pushed me to expand and learn on a more professional scale. Shes always open to questions and critique, and wants you to participate all the time. She is really open to talking and is always willing to help. Great experience overall!, I still keep in touch with Debra two years after I took her class because thats how valuable information she gives and she is a very good connection to have in your network., I got my first internship because of Debra and Debra alone. Her recommendation carries so much weight. I would recommend taking Debra only if youre up for a non-traditional class., Debra is amazing! Would highly recommend her if you want to be successful in your career., Shes an amazing mentor. This is not a typical writing class but Debra prepares you for your career., From an academic standpoint, Debra is likely to rub you the wrong way. From a career standpoint, especially to those with internship experience, youre getting a pretty solid amount of information and introduction to industry. The best bang for your buck if you talk to Debra about non-school related topics during office hours. Engage and thrive!, 100W has a lot of writing but the class is literally named technical writing so I don\t see why people are complaining. She\s one of the most caring teachers I\ve had and her making us go to the career fair got me an internship! She always willing to help and has extra office hours on her own time. I don\t like 100w but Debra is an amazing mentor, i used to enjoy going to class and learning interview tips and how to improve your resume and doing applicable stuff. then we started working on the proof of concept which is basically like a 15 page entrepreneur project to train you to be a project manager for no reason. now i wish i never have to see or talk to debra again. AVOID HER IF YOU CAN., I think I hate this class more than any other class I\ve ever taken. She acts like doing the proof of concept is going to get us a job. Constantly says I\m in the industry and this is what employers want to see. What a waste of time. I would have a MUCH better chance at landing a job if it was a software project or spent the time on leetcode., This class was so overwhelming yet useless. The workload is insane; no way its a 3 unit class. She makes you use sh*tty Adobe products, and now I hate Adobe. The worst thing is that it could be a fun class but she makes it so stressful and serious. If you can skip or take it with someone else, for the love of baby Jesus please do., Debra is nice, but super gossipy. She claims to code but I doubt she can. She claims a lot of things to inflate her reputation. She makes it seem like her class and assignments are super important but they are not. Like many other people have said this class is entirely busy work., This may be your most useless class. Time comsuming and you can learn nothing. If you want to be a product manager or start own business, this class is pretty good. But if you are a software engineer, please stay away from her class. Lots HWs, video resume, 2-mins POC video and 6000+ words POC, 97+ A grade, 94+ A- grade., Shes so great, I dont understand the bad reviews? She goes above and beyond for students, you can reach her outside of class, she connects really well with everyone. She gives great advice on how to email, talk to recruiters, and get internships. The class in general is informational and the semester project is actually very useful., Awful class. All classwork and homework is busywork, as is the PoC. The PoC takes up majority of time, and I found it to be highly irrelevant and pointless. Everything taught by Prof. Caires is either common sense or things you would have learned several times over the years. Overall, while it is not hard to get a good grade, its a pointless class, She is a good professor that you cant even dream for. I can listen to every single word from her but not some other professors. Its your good luck if you can choose her, Not a super hard professor, just gives you a lot of busy work (filling out documents, doing quizzes, submitting discussions). Wish the content taught was more relevant though, sometimes it seemed pointless and didnt seem like it was intended to make us become better technical writers, Shes a nice professor. But her class is not that useful. The POC is useless to most people, because not everyone wants to start their own business. I wish she could spend more time on resume and Linkedin, they are more important than the POC., This is the most caring professor I have ever had. She really wants you to succeed. She is available to every student current and past. Shes always available for advice. She prepares us for the environment in the future by making us do assignments that would be impressive to employers. One critique is she forces us to do English work., Debra is an amazing Professor. She really cares about her students. She was the only one of my professors that knew how to transition to an online teaching environment due to COVID-19. Make sure to do all of your assignments so you dont have to work as hard on your final project! Also, she likes to call on her students randomly during Zoom., You have to take this exact class with this exact teacher so I wont even bother reviewing her. U have 7% of the grade to lose to get A. 60% r basic quizzes/discussion: get full pts on them. 20% for final grammar test: not ez, u can lose 2-3% max on it (10 - 15 pts out of 100). 20% for final portfolio: BS the 2 min pitch, BS the PoC, and ez A., My view of this class may be different from urs bcuz it became online due to Covid 19 (had access to recordings of class, took final online). Material isnt hard, but it could stack up if you procrastinate. There were some unnecessary assignments, but the class helped me build a nice resume and LinkedIn. Learned Adobe XD which was nice. She was ok., Debra wants the best for students but a lot of this class is just busy work for the sake of it. She makes you install Adobe bloatware for the final portfolio under the premise that future employers will like this. Honestly, future employers would rather see you take on coding projects rather than show them you can make a pretty webpage on AdobeXD, I dont see why theres so many bad reviews; all she does is lecture on career topics to help you succeed in your job search. While the work thats graded is completely useless in terms of your career, the class is seriously an easy A. Class is typically lecture Mon/Tues, in class activity Wed/Thurs. Only big deal was the prototype project, ez A+, This was a very useless class. I was hoping I could learn how to write technical reports, but instead, we spent 90% of the class going over resumes and interviewing. The grading criteria makes no sense, and I received 0s on multiple assignments I did and turned in on time., Some of the stuff we learned in class was very useful (like writing resumes or interviewing at companies). Most the rest of the class was useless busy work. She is a very nice teacher, but I would avoid her if you can., 1. Buy the access code only, dont buy the book 2. Online quizzes due every sunday 3. Activities in class matter and you have to submit in-class work DURING class. They are easy. 4. Always come to class 5. Work on your portfolio ahead of time 6. Easy grader, She gave us so many assignments that eventually she herself forgot some of them. We got feedbacks on our very first draft of abstract after we submitted our final paper. Nice person, bad teacher. I think she gave everybody a B at the end., Lacks clear process and makes you work on multiple assignments simultaneously. Grading criteria was tough. Grades didnt reflect effort that was put in. However, she does help with soft skill development., 1. The book cost around 50 bucks to take quiz. The quiz is full of bs. 2. I am shocked of how much of BS she can come up with. 3. On the first class, she asked us to read others POC without telling us what she wants, and expect us to know by reading others. 4. 75% of classes just sitting on the front and write recommendations for former studen, Debra teaches skills that can be used on a career fast-track. Her class is very different and pushes students out of the comfort zone. You must ask questions if youre confused. Study for the grammar test, its very difficult. Tip: Dont do only the bare minimum on Proof of Concept assignments. The work WILL pile up if it is left incomplete., Debra is the sweetest person. If you get to know her, she is incredibly nice and will do whatever she can to help you prosper. The class format changed this semester, so it was significantly easier, theres no semester long project. Like another review said, the grammar final at the end is really difficult, we got a pre final assessment though., Debra is not only a great teacher, she is an awesome career coach. This class is not about coding or program design, but about how to write professional communications, sell yourself on the job market, and get a job. However, do not expect an easy A: you will need to put in some time. Beware of her grammar exam, it is hard, really hard., Debra is a nice person. However, she tried to achieve too many things for students all at once. And thus, her course resulted in many students not knowing what to do and confused. I couldnt really recall what I had learned in the class as she always said a lot of technical terms without giving good examples. I wish she can improve the class., Debra has an admirable vision for the class but falls short when it comes to implementation. Entire class hinges on project which will be a ton of work, and might suck if you get burned with a bad client. Only meets for lecture once a week but a ton of assignments and documentation will bog you down. However she is very open to help when needed., This class consists of 1 big project( pick project and group wisely), 5 blogs that you have to write and publish, 1 grammar test, Resume work, Agile terminology throughout the course, lots of homework, presentations, WebEx meetings with the  professor and your group (2-3 times per week).Only take this class if you have lot of free time or good luck, You dont learn anything technical from this class, nor you do any technical writing. This class will suck up all of your time with group meetings and  lots of homework. Ita lot of self learning for the projects and totally not worth the time and effort at the end. A lot of students cant escape from this class coz of limited sections offered :(, Debra has very good intentions. She wants to teach you the standard practices of the industry. She assigns a semester long group project, but she often gives you documents and expects you to finish them. If she doesnt like them, prepare to revise them many times. Often disorganized and leaves you confused. Forced to use multiple web platforms., Great person, terrible professor. Tries her best to teach what\s part of industry, but is often unconvincing. Highly disorganized. Be ready to constantly check email and a number of different platforms for assignments. Class is dependent on a semester long group project. Try to take class with a friend. Will help in a pinch if asked., Debra is a good person, and shes easy to get along with. The problem is that the class is incredibly unstructured. She tries to help, but most of the time it ends up confusing people, her criteria isnt clear, and the class is far from easy. Massive group project that will take up all your free time., Highly disorganized course that drains far too much of your free time. Debra will constantly assign work without adequately explaining it during lecture. Weekly Webex / in-person meetings are required outside of class time, with a client or Debra, and can end up clashing with your schedule, watch out!   Class is 95% group work after a few weeks in., There were many weeks where she just sat at her desk and said nothing. She spends very little time explaining assignments or providing feedback, and used Facebook for ALL of her announcements. She tends to put up assignments late on Sunday evenings and expects you to finish them by Monday morning. Avoid a having full schedule with her class., Not really a technical writing class as I thought it would be. In this class you write blogs and project documentation, and work with a client on a project of some sort. Stay on top of the work and it isnt that bad. She leaves the class chaotic; just pay attention to it all., How on earth this class received certification for Computer Science Major ? Not every computer scientists is into poster making and taking 6th grade grammar tests... She also makes you to read an outdated 15-year old Agile methodology. Very disorganized and useless class. I want my money back... now., WORST class I have taken in my entire life and I\m a senior. She excuses her disorganization by saying that\s how the real world is. Honestly, I\ve had internships and  full time jobs and NO, the real world is not this disorganized. This class consumes a bulk of your time so avoid taking with too many other classes. Good Luck!, Shes kinda all over the place, very confusing with assignments, and spams your email with vague messages. She has good connections with recruiters though, I just wish her class was more organized. It feels like its disorganized on purpose. She uses facebook for messages, Debra is very eccentric to say the least. The group projects rarely require actual computer science or programming, but are demanding in terms of time commitment nonetheless. It was a pretty stressful class., Her assignments are hard, true. But they give you experience in what CS majors need, mainly projects and customer interaction. Debra is one of the most helpful and well connected people at this school without a doubt. Get on her good side!, Very down to earth and made attending the lectures entertaining. But most importantly made a state-mandated writing class into really useful career coaching. 90% of the work is done outside lecture on your own time but since the lecture only meets once a week that offsets most extra required time., Debra is a great professor. She makes the class lectures fun and entertaining. Granted there is a lot of work expected, but she cancels one lecture every week to give you extra time. Most of it is group work, but she does recognize when people do not work hard and others make up for it. I learned so much from her class and I recommend it., Seems very disorganized but if you talk with her she is helpful, She UNDERSTANDS the computer technology and how to make use of it very well., Debra is quite open to students, but is confusing with her assignments at the same time. I got pretty mixed up, as well as the whole class, over many assignment criteria. But be sure to ask for clarification otherwise no one else may, ending up in the professor not realizing her own unclarity. Ask in front of the class so others dont need to again, Atrocious class. The class is poorly organized, possibly on purpose. CS100W is supposed to be about technical writing, but there wasnt even a cursory treatment of technical writing. The one technical writing assignment you have is just THERE, and there is no lecture leading to it. The class dropbox is overloaded with too much information. Etc., One of the most real professors.  She gives you a lot of work and doesn\t tell you how to manage it.  In a way she is teaching you how to take the things you are given and managing them yourself.But at the same time it isn\t good.  Otherwise, good professor, she is a recruiter , she will pound you on your resume and CVs when the time comes., Prof. Caires offers a well designed class to prepare us for our future. You have to do your part of the work and be willing to figure out things, which sometimes are left unclear, on purpose. She is very helpful and I learned a lot in that class. Is sad that so many people criticize but they simply didnt get the chance at growing up., Worst.class.ever. I really wish it was more like other 100w classes. Debra is very inconsistent with the information she tells from student to student, and does not explain what she wants from you., Im not even halfway through the semester and Im already tired of this b. This is the only class I dread to go to every week. Thank god you only meet up once a week, or I would die. She likes to spam your email with separate emails about one subject. She does not even have any background in CS. She is horrible at giving instructions.Useless class, I cannot believe I am saying this right now, but this is the most stressful class out of my schedule. And Im talking some pretty challenging and difficult classes. We havent done much in this class yet, but trust me, when you have no idea what the hell youre doing every time you walk into a classroom, you will feel the burn. Horrible professor., Shes really nice if you go in and talk to her one-on-one and listen to her stories. However she is unclear at times, but if you ask her for help with precise questions, she can really help you. As long as you keep up with the work and dont slack off, youll have an easier time with this class. Also, dont bite off more than you can chew., Ive never had a professor be so unclear about assignments. I worked my butt off, compensating for some useless group members, and didnt get my A. I did thrice the work required, but I dont receive thrice the grades. Everything in this class is group work. Computer Science majors who have yet to take her class, I salute you..., Easily gets off tangent but extremely approachable. Pray to god that your group members arent slackers or you will hate this class. Be prepared to visit her often during office hours to have the homework clarified or else you and your team mates will be lost. Key to passing the class: team work and office hours. Otherwise, this class was fun for m, Professor Caires is an extremely nice, and well meaning person. The toughest challenge students will find is figuring out what is expected. Make sure you ask her for clarification and you DO turn something in, youll be fine, she will tell you exactly what to correct to re-turn it in. Make sure you join a large group, with people who WILL work!, The work in this class was tedious, but it was NOT hard. Follow the coversheets and make an effort. Debra is truly an amazing individual if you get a chance to talk to her. She has a big heart! I enjoy her anecdotes in class, and it sure as heck beats lecturing from powerpoint. If you allow yourself to, youll get something out of this course., Shes OK. I guess. shes the only teacher for this required course, and be ready when you take it because its a roller-coaster!!!, From an A student:\n Easiness: She gives fifteen extra pages of writing beyond the 8000 word requirement, claiming that it will meet Area R.  It won\t.\n Helpfulness: You can email her, but her answers are useless.  I asked her an X or Y question and got back Yes.\n Clarity: The directions for one assignment were spread out across five emails., Her instructions are vague and she is never clear about her requirements for assignments. Most of your time in this class will be spent trying to figure out what she wants you to do. Its been a very frustrating experience, so I implore anyone seeking an 100W to look into the Engineering departments 100W rather than this one., Spends so much time talking herself up and failing to convince the administration to increase the unit rating to actually spend time helping students and so leaves everything to the students. Information presented is common sense but treated as extremely important. Abandons students to figure out what she wants as far as assignments content., This teacher is all right.  Shes nice and has some funny stories to tell to make the lectures entertaining.  The only problems I have with the class are 1) the ridiculous amount of crap we have to print and turn in with every paper 2) the fact that you have to follow HER format on every assignment you turn in 3) the Newsletter., She gets a lot of ratings. As you can see, its not just from a few hateful students.She will load you up with unreasonable work and give you no time to finish. She will make you do accounting work in a technical writing class. Her assignments are not hard, they are just tedious and long and unnecessary. They will drive you crazy. Thumb down., All i am going to say is...Good luck. because u will need EVERY bit of luck u can get. and i mean that with all my heart., The class is required for CS and she is the only teacher.I knew this teacher would be bad before I started the class. Nothing anyone told or could of told me would prepare me for this class. The class is horrible. She is just horrible.But plain and simple you have no idea what to do for the assignments. Good luck trying to get ?s answered by email, DO NOT TAKE. this professor will make your life miserable. She will not explain ANYTHING and will expect you to figure it out on your own. All she does is talk about her self and how great she is. Everything done in class is useless and time consuming. One of my midterm papers was 25 pages long and i still got a B-. DO NOT TAKE!, Took in Fall 2008. This semester she made the class alot easier compared to previous semesters. Dont buy the Bedford handbook, there is no use for it! I wasted $50. Total costs for materials was ~$50 for color printing, poster boards, etc. Its easier at the beginning of the semester but you will do alot of work near the end. (PART 1/2), PROS: Only spent $60 for this class, not $200.  Easy to get good grades on assignments if you follow her templates.  CONS: Lots of research and lots of writing.  Cant stand her lectures.  Overly dramatic and cant stop talking about how great she is!  MY ADVICE:  She wont tell you how to do the assignments so ask LOTS of questions.  Good luck!, Very unclear in her assignment. Requirement can change at will. If there is another alternative professor teaching 100W, nobody would take this professor. Prepare to spend some money. Otherwise I got some interview tips from this class., Lot of people said shes hard and her class is not useful. I also have some friends took her class for more than 3 to 4 times. But for me shes not that bad. Just "
Qi Yang,/professor/2576815,1.8,26%,4.3,"Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 46A professor @ SJSU when I took the class. I regret not waiting because his class was hell since he made me and my classmates cry feel dumb as he expected novice coders to be fluent in Java., This was the worst professor I ever had. He expects students in an Intro to Programming course to be fluent in Java and due to his heavy accent, nobody understands a word he says. I am so glad that he no longer teaches CS 46A., If you took his class, you would know exactly the definition of a nightmare.

He expected beginner programmers to be fluent in Java and was condescending when discussing the difficulty of the class. I am so sorry if you were stuck to take him., Does not care if students understand the material or not. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands the concept and skips multiple steps when teaching. Very condescending., How did SJSU hire him? Im so glad they got someone else to teach 46A since this guy is a joke and expects people with little to no coding experience to be experts in Java on the first day. Students needed outside resources if they wanted to pass., This professor was the worst! He never helped his students out with anything as he expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java., So glad hes no longer at SJSU., A really easy class to get an A in if you do homework and put in the work to learn coding. The lectures are alright but the slides are great and help you learn. Instructions are somewhat unclear. Tests have same difficulty as practice. Overall, great professor and I really enjoyed his class., He taught the class without knowing the title as he believed all 100+ students in his Introduction to Programming in Java class were fluent in Java. He also has a heavy accent so no one can understand a word he says and is intimidating when he talks about the difficulty of the class, which discourages lots of students., As an Introduction to Programming class, this was one of the hardest possible classes ever. Poor teacher, bad at explaining, constant amounts of homework, massive difficult semesterly exams. The difficulty of this class is higher than it needs to be. AVOID AT ALL COST, try to transfer., If you get this professor, take my advice and drop his class within the easy drop period. His lectures are pretty much garbage and he expects students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java., This was one of, if not THE worst teacher I ever had. He did not help you that much whe students asked for it. He was very hard to understand due to his accent. Then when you have to turn in your homework, he makes you do it the exact way he wants to do it or else you do not get credit., Why would SJSU hire such a terrible professor? He expects programmers in an Introduction to Programming class to be fluent in Java and does not know how to explain problems well. Also, when you ask him questions he does not know how to provide answers and often discourages students. If you have him I suggest dropping (which is what I did)., He is pretty hard to understand in class because of his thick accent and because he goes extremely fast in his lectures. He also uses software that he specifically says that he does not know how to use (iClicker) and expects students with little to no coding experience to be fluent in Java. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, try to transfer., Does not care if students understand the material or not. Questions asked in class are usually deflected. His teaching method does not even make sense. He acts as if everyone in class already previously understands Java when they are just beginners. He is also very condescending and intimidating., Extremely unforgiving and lacks empathy regardless of your situation. Had him since he was the only CS 46A professor when I got to SJSU. He expects novice coders to be fluent in Java and used software he specifically stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker). He was also intimidating and his accent made it hard for us to understand things., The WORST professor Ive ever had at SJSU. His teaching methods are very unclear and hes very unhelpful. He only teaches to get paid. Assignments are SUPER hard. He expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java and does not review the material. Just awful. Avoid him at all costs!, Usually I take RMP reviews lightly since most people will only speak on their bad experiences but TRUST ME WHEN I SAY HE IS GENUINELY A TERRIBLE PROFESSOR. He expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java and I do not think he cares about the success and well-being of his students. Extremely hard professor for NO REASON. Avoid at all costs, I dont believe it. No matter what it had taken for me to get right, this professor has been throwing away points on all assignments, because he never showed any sufficient examples in lecture. He also uses software he specifically stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker) and expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java., Does not care if students understand the material or not. Questions asked in class are usually deflected. His teaching method does not even make sense and expects his students to be fluent in Java despite the course being an Intro to Programming class., Horrible and extremely intimidating professor. Do not even bother with this professor. Drop the class if you can and save your GPA. The lectures were bad, he did not care about anyone, and he never helped his students out with anything., Terrible instructor, he doesnt even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how the university would hire someone this bad to teach. He is extremely strict, his lectures are confusing and he doesnt explain clearly. His exams are very hard, he expects novice programmers to be fluent in Java. Please do the students a favor and fire him., Professor yangs lectures consist of him reading off slides and disregarding any questions about the code on the slides. I would recommend you be familiar with Java and some programming syntax in order to really excel in this class, otherwise you will have a hard time as Professor Yang is not very helpful., This professor was the worst! He does not even deserve the professor title. I do not understand how SJSU hired someone this bad to teach. He never helped his students out with anything, lectures were bad, and he used software (iClicker) he specifically said he did not know how to use. Listen to the rest of the reviews and do NOT take the teacher., He does not know how to teach at all since he just read off of the slides and was intimidating when he talked about the difficulty of the class by saying if the class was too hard, we could switch to CS 22A. IDK how he expects students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java., I only took his class for a week and am so glad I dropped it. He expected students in an Intro to Programming class to be fluent in Java. He also uses software he explicitly stated that he did not know how to use (iClicker) and was intimidating by saying, If you think this class is too hard or going too fast, you can switch to CS 22A., This is honestly the worst professor ever. He just reads off the slides during lectures and cannot provide insight on how to code. He is also intimidating when talking about the difficulty of the class and uses software (iClicker) he does not know how to use., Worst professor ever. He is condescending towards his students when talking about how hard the class is and just reads off the slides during lectures., Other than being unable to understand what he says due to his heavy accent, he scares his students about how hard the class is and expects students in an Introduction to Programming class to be experts in coding. I also did not understand why he used iClicker when he specifically told his students that he does not know how to use it., He mainly gets a bad reputation due to his accent during lectures, but he has good slides you can follow on your own. Also he gives plenty of time for homework and exams, and makes it clear what hell take off points for. \n\nExams also resemble practice exams and lectures so its easy to pass if you actually try., Bad lecturer, can seem a little harsh at times regarding the difficulty of the class. However, I had no prior coding experience and was able to complete the exams with a lot of extra time. The slides he presents are really useful and give examples similar to those on the homework and in-class problems (which the exams are very similar to)., Yang is a horrible lecturer, and cannot provide any insight into how to write code. But that does not mean his lecturers are unimportant. If you are present during lectures and pay attention, you can do the exams in less than 40 minutes with no problems. There are tricks and clarifications on coding assignments in his lectures., This is the worst professor ever. I dont know why a professor teaching an Intro to Programming class expects his students to be experts in coding. He should not be a professor because he is mean and does not know how to teach., I do not understand why he expects his students in an Intro to Programming class to be experts in coding. I also do not understand why he uses iClicker after he tells his students he does not know how to use it. I\m so glad I dropped his class., Heavyish accent. His lectures were him reading off of his slideshows while showing off some examples of code he would run us through. Online textbook where quizzes were held, participation assignments every session, HW due every week, 2 midterms + final. Start assignments early and use the discord for help! Simple class but requires effort., Ok, Im gonna be honest, this is the worst teacher that I have ever had. I cant understand half the things he says, when you ask for help or advice he is either confused or dosent fully explain it. The finals are a huge part of your grade so watch out., Homework assignments will eat up your time, so make sure to start them early. Has a heavy accent, so its pretty hard to understand what hes saying. Tests were formatted exactly like the homework assignments, but were more difficult and you had much less time to do them., I took it in 2021 fall as a hybrid class. Be ready for lots of hw and labs every week, not a really a hard grader. If you have no experience with coding, dont take it it will be a struggle. He just read off the the slides during his lecture class., The professors class is really lecture heavy. There are homework and participation assignments when I took him last semester, with the graders sometimes being very picky when it comes to taking off points. Study the hw and pars and you will be fine. HOWEVER, this class is not beginner friendly, so beware of that., Worst CS professor ever, reads off the slideshow the entire time and expects you to understand Java fluently. Graders are very dumb and mark down points for unnecessary things, This class really is not a introductory class and gives many new CS students a bad first experience with CS. It is as if the class wants you to change your Major. Topics are explained as if you know Java already. Tests are actually quite fair as it is open notes. If you know some Java, you should be OK, otherwise look for others for help., He is a good teacher. He often reads the comment section and then answers student questions. Most of the tests are not difficult, the last questions in the final exam are not easy, but as long as you hand in, he will give 5 points, so it is really easy to pass this course. You only need to complete all the exercises in the book, Tests are based on lectures. Ask questions by going to his office hours and/or emailing him as he is very helpful. This classs difficulty increases exponentially as time passes. He tries his best to help. Remember that ultimately it is the level of determination and persistence that you have which determines your success and not the professor., 2 tests(4 q\s), 1 final (6 q\s). Both are open notes Tests  fair, study the review well Final  unfair, study the review well and pray he is merciful for the 6th challenging problem As a professor  Exists. He will NOT let you make up assignments for ANY points even if something beyond your control happens. Slideshow lectures (decent info)., I personally enjoyed Yangs class, and about like 80% of the students got at least a B- in his class. Make sure to make/join the discord server for his class, super helpful, and also pay attention to deadlines and to the assignment prompts. No group assignments besides partner work in the lab, and about 4-8 assignments per wk, most of it was ez., Qi Yang is a very complicated professor, that enjoys giving work, he once said If this class is too hard, you can always switch to an easier one Its okay if you are not good at computer science, you can always switch majors This class will discourage you if you are a beginner, do not take it as a beginner you will definitely struggle, Not an intro to java class. Lots of work, and put a lot of effort studying., Total 11 homework, 1 per week, 23 participation assignments, 1 every lecture. Lots of slides to read, lecture wont be that helpful but you should attend for iclicker. Hes very lenient when grading exams with partial credit, You wont fail if you did your readings and notes. Best tips is to organize every file with specific names, useful for exam., very organized class, but many moving parts (participation, quizzes, hw, labs - all of these every week), but it is good preparation. I would say the hardest parts are the exams - you have to work really quick to get to all the problems, so practice by timing yourself. I didnt have any prior experience and I got an A, just do the work, Really liked the structure of this class. There was a lot of HW, which provided a lot of preparation for the tests and helped to quickly get us comfortable with Java. Didnt find the lectures very useful, but this class is an easy A if you are experienced in coding in another language already. The exams consist of coding problems similar to the HW., Qi Yang deserves a low score because the class is not Introductory. In fact, he recommends you have prior coding experience. The homework\s/Timed tests are heavy if you are new. I formed a study group, hired a private tutor, did his HW, still got a C+. Please learn coding prior to entering the class! Don\t make the same mistake as I did., As an international student with no prior programming knowledge, his accent was hard to understand at the start but then it got easier. Do the pre-class work and homework and youll be fine. Read the book tests are usually the same as the homework. He teaches from PowerPoint presentations. Tests are time heavy. Not a bad experience overall!, This class is gonna be tough especially if you dont have any prior coding experience. If you put in the effort and read through his slides and textbook, you should do fine as long as you understand what is being taught. Be cautious when coding as he is very particularly and strict about the styling. His lectures arent the best, but are sufficient, Grading is very strict on homework and tests. If you are new to programming, etc this class will be much harder so you have to make sure to study a lot on your own time, etc. A few good things professor does is give participation problems after classes and replaces your second midterm score with your final exam score if you do better on the final., The HW and tests are not beginner friendly. Graders take off points on homework for the tiniest things, so it wont hurt to triple check your work before submitting. Profs lecture slides are good, but his actual lecturing could use some work., The power-point format that the professor uses isnt for everyone. I wish he would have explained terms more in-depth rather than just reading off the screen. He is a fairly nice person, though the TAs grade for every little mistake. This class is test-heavy and will be difficult for people without prior programming experience. Good luck!, He isnt the worst of professors, he can be difficult to understand sometimes. His lectures arent super useful but attend anyway. Take the help of TAs, your classmates, his slides, office hours, create a discord server. Really do your homework and quizzes. Go through the textbook and you will be fine. Go in expecting to work., dont bother showing up to the lectures, biggest waste of time. you are better off reading from the textbook and self-teaching. the homeworks take a few hours to complete if you dont know what youre doing. the exams are pretty easy for the most part, but the wording of some prompts are questionable., Stopped showing up for lectures even though attendance is mandatory. Professor Yang could use a lot of improvement in his lectures, as they are often pointless summaries of the readings. You\re better off getting help during his office hours. Homework problems are engaging but do not reflect real-life problems, and exam problems are difficult., I dont think Professor Yang is a bad teacher, I just dont think his teaching style lines up with the CS46A curriculum. The exams were extremely long and as someone with decent prior experience in software I wasnt ever able to complete them, yet there was seldom a curve applied meaning most of the class just failed. Id give him a second chance., Hes a nice guy, doesnt speak English very well but will do his best to answer your questions. The problem is lecture, he does not go very in depth and if you have no prior programming experience do not take 46A with him, which is kind of ridiculous since this is supposed to be an introductory class., Amazing guy, He doesnt give good feedback and is really boring. Probably need some programming experience before taking this class in order to do well. Study hard for the exams!, Mr Yang is an okay teacher, though his accent makes lots of his lectures harder to understand. Tests are long and you are only given an hour. If you are new to CS, find another teacher. The TAs grade SUPER harshly and you get minus points for every thing thing. Forget some java doc? -1. Code not neat? -2. Read the book and format your code right., Professor Qi Yang is not for everyone. You will defiantly need to understand or have prior programming knowledge. His exams are long and it will be likely that you will not able to finish. He has thick accents so get ready to be confused. Homeworks are fare, not really that hard. My advice is to watch videos and do homework. Good luck., Honestly the hardest teacher I have ever had. He doesnt know how to teach at all and this class is pretty much impossible unless you have a solid background of computer science already. Its sad because it is supposed to be an introductory class and is meant to teach you. The class is so fast paced and theres also a ton of assignments and lessons"
Chris Pollett,/professor/214943,3.3,53%,3.7,"Memorizing for a database course is crazy. Even worse than Mike Wu., The class coverts way too much material, but most of it is not on the exam. Just practice his old one exams and read through ALL of the slides. His exams have a guaranteed 2 questions from practice exam and 3 for final. So, not a tough class overall. Just spend some time learning and youll get an A. His curve is quiet generous as well., Lectures can be dense with material.  This class covers a lot over one semester.   At one point we were about 2-3 lectures ahead, and then some how got behind a lecture by the end of the semester.  \n\nMidterm and Final was hand written, closed notes, closed book., His slides are too dense with information so get ready to memorize. His homework is a mix of coding and textbook problems. The tests are a bit difficult but it seems he reuses or modifies his exam problems. So try to know how to do his previous semester exam problems., Covers too much material (many are meant for OTHER courses) and poorly explains them. Expects students to memorize an ungodly amount of information and small details (an entire textbook). Those details make it hard to remember the important points of a concept. Exam questions are random, so he may completely skip a topic. HW doesnt prepare you., His slides are helpful since it shows code examples but has a lot of information. His HW are challenging but you can work in a group for them. HW build on top of each other so keep up with the material. I recommend going to his office hours for help. For his exams, study his practice exams from his previous semesters. Overall, an okay professor., 5 HWs, first one is easy, but the rest are hard and feel draining. Have option to do them on their own, but you kinda have to do them in groups because they are a lot of work. 55% is a C-, easy to pass, hard to get a good grade. Too much PHP, I wish the class was focused on Javascript, I didnt like this class as much as I thought I would., Pollett is incredibly knowledgable and passionate for web development.\n\nHowever, he makes this ELECTIVE class an incredible pain to take. In-person midterm and final where you write CODE with pencil and has a terrible hw3.\n\nMan made his class so unnecessarily hard he had to include cheats so everyone somehow passes.\n\nWhat a joke., - Homework is hard and vague (especially for the coding part). Do expect heavy coding.\n- He usually doesnt quite know the details of the homework and even changes the requirement two days before the deadline\n- Heavy test but quite easy as long as you attend every course\n- Midterm and Final are hard and heavy memorizing (terms + math formula), If you want an A in this class (which nobody got), get ready to memorize every single slide. His midterm and final questions were vague and random, with ALL short answer. 5 homework assignments. It is not too hard to pass the class since a 50% is passing, but due to the insanely hard tests and harsh grading, it is nearly impossible to get an A., There will be a class activity and quiz every week, very easy if you review the slides before class. The course is heavy on midterms and finals which involve a good amount of memorization. There are 5 assignments that are very much doable if you have some idea of python and speak to the professor to understand what is expected. Everyone got an A/A-, 5 HWs, 1 midterm, 1 final. 1 in-class exercise & quiz every week. Do the in-class exercises cus they give insurance points for midterm and final (very difficult). Average scores incl. insurance points: midterm 13/20, final 14/30. Lectures are super boring and taken straight from the textbook. Put in effort and youll pass prob. No one got an A., Really great! Participate in class and ask questions! Hes really nice. The homeworks were super hard, but you can form a group, so do it! The tests are kind of hard, but hell give you bonus points. He doesnt always give enough examples for coding stuff, but hes open to talking and helping you always, so its not so bad. Would take again!, The way this class is setup, its impossible to fail. As long as you turn in something for all homeworks, do in-class problems and quizzes you will pass. You will need to work very hard for an A though, Chriss homework assignments are no joke. Exams are hard but there are a lot of safety nets to get points back. The class is fair but a time sink., Somethings you should know before taking CS154: He teaches this class as an abstract math class He reads theories, definitions, or lemmas and DOES NOT provide examples He assumes you understand everything after reading it once He expects you to spend 1-5 hrs on hw (it takes longer) The midterm was take-home (due to COVID) and took everyone 5-8 hrs, Weekly quizzes (Mondays) and in class activities (Wednesdays). A really solid professor. His exams are doable. His homeworks do take a while but stress important points. Overall, I liked him., 50% of your grade is hw, which is great, but it will also take a serious amount of time to complete them and they will not be easy. Post lectures online. There will be quizzes every week which you must be present for. You will need at least 55% to pass, but going into the final the students class average was about.... you guessed it 55%, Dr. Pollett is by far one of the best professors at SJSU. His lectures are heavy but if you put in the time you can do very well. He gives out extra credit points very often, so come to class. All lectures are recorded and all slides are posted online so there are no excuses for not passing the class., As a professor one of the best at San Jose State, but the slides could use an update, they make lectures boring. Sometimes the lectures are just too much to take in and the examples are very simple compared to the actual problem. But you can always clear these things as he is approachable and will help you in his office hours., He is one of the best professor at SJSU CS department. His assignments are good. You will get to learn a lot. He is extremely helpful. Course syllabus is good. Course assignments were in PHP. I heard that next semester he is introducing some Node JS stuff as well. If you want to learn server side web programming, then go for it., Gives lectures slides online and video recording of lectures, but his lectures are boring bc he likes to give unnecessary details about some concepts. For hw, he expects you to have understood the new languages (PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL) within a short timeframe and write complex programs with them. Hw instructions are poorly formatted & worded., Very knowledgeable professor. Quiz every week., Dr. Pollett is tremendous and by far the best professor I have had at SJSU.  The class is challenging but if you work and study hard, you should be fine.  He is friendly, approachable, and willing to help you with the harder concepts during office hours.  I recommend Dr. Pollett and this class to everyone who wants to learn artificial intelligence., Theres a ton of material in AI, and its all weird, wild, and new, but Pollett does EVERYTHING to make the class doable. 55% is a C-. Quizzes are EZ (just review the lecture slides, which are ALWAYS available). Drops ur lowest HW and 3 quiz scores. Gives xtensions on HW. HW is in Python, so this is a python class 2. Gives extra credit. Good prof., Dr. Pollet clearly knows his stuff, but he assumes that you have a strong background in programming and will constantly spew technical terms (and ummuh) in his lectures. The assignments and exams are very difficult, though its offset by very generous curves and extra credit.  Go to his office hours because hes quite a nice and helpful person., He is really smart, and class topic is interesting. However, he doesnt really know HOW to teach topic. Grading is fair, but exam is hard, Hard class. Hes reasonable. very low MT score(4/20), gave us half pts back, did all the Hw(6/10 difficulty). Got only half the quiz points and +5 bonus for rand stuff. Walked into the final passing (55/100 = c-). Final was easier then MT. Grading system is strait forward knew my score and what i had to do to pass (whole class is out of 100 pts), He limits his office hours a lot since he uses that time to write his slides. He then proceeds to take class time to fix his typos in PHP. Stumbles over reading his slides the whole time without much input when a question is asked. Class average on the one and only midterm was a 20% but he was nice enough to allow redos to earn points back :)., Not good. Its been 9 years since hes taught the class. His grading is inconsistent, you wont know what you did wrong because hell grade differently even if its the same work twice. Avoid at all cost., Very hard class! Especially the homework., His lectures are unclear and unexplained,  he grades like its a pass fail class, Grades everything this way: 100%, 50%, or 0%, 55% is a C-, more than half of the class is currently failing. He is a teacher that never took a teaching class. The subject is hard to begin with, but the way he teaches it compounds the difficulty. STAY AWAY AT ALL COST!, Overall a good learning experience, he is straight forward, humble, full of enthusiasm, knowledgeable and crystal clear grading policy., The material was very interesting and he was good at explaining it. However, instead of being an Android/iOS/HTML5 course he really should have chosen one subject. Tests you on what you can memorize from an extremely broad range of problems across all three languages, which is ridiculously daunting. Took this class for enrichment; wish I hadnt., One of the good professors at SJSU CS dept. All his courses are worth every penny. Very helpful and has very good knowledge of subjects he handles. Very humble, non-biased , Creative and fun loving person., Best teacher ever at SJSU CS or Engineering. About the only other decent one is Mark Stamp. Actually explains things well and doesnt leave you wondering what you are supposed to be learning or doing., Very helpful and resourceful instructor. He is one of the few professors that will spend time making sure you understand the concept (if you ask for help). He isnt that easy though just to warn you all., Terrible! Expected us to write an interpreter as a second assignment and expected us to know how to program finite automatas! CS154 is NOT a pre-req for this class, nor is this class a compiler design class. Third assignment was to write an interpreter for C++ and didnt even tell us how to parse the language...thanks., Great professor, technically sound... explains all concepts clearly.. helps a lot during office hours... good grading.. everyone must take his class at least once, Lectures are UN-structured.  Reads directly off of his slides (available online) without giving any further input.  Slides were copied directly from the textbook.  Says umm uh umm uh a lot.  Midterm and final are ridiculously stringent. Asks open-ended questions and expects an exact, specific answer.  No partial credit.  DON\T take him!, This was a tough subject. There is a lot to cover for web programming. So many web programming languages. Not what I expected, but I made it. His midterm and final is pretty hard because there is so much information to retain for it. From what I heard from his semester at Mozilla, he made the class much harder than before., Very hard subject. So much stuff to go through and cover. He has very through slides that covers everything he teaches. His midterm and final is tough. Assignments are pretty challenging as well. According to others, he is much harder than in previous semesters., Very unavailable. fairly rigid in grading. I liked the subject more before I took the class with him. Pretty knowlegeable in the subject but poor presentation. records and posts his lectures. Posts his lecture notes. Could have done better if he was more available. Does NOT respond to individual email period. no chance for late assignments, Still very organized, clear, approachable, and relevant, Dr. Pollett has improved his oral presentation skills dramatically since my last review in 2006.  Hes rapidly grown to be one of my favorites in the department., Very good Professor. Has total clarity and command on the subject. Homeworks are extremely interesting and hard. Extremely helpful, answers every question. Grading is like, you earn what you deserve. Wonderful Prof!, Rocking!!......Helpful, Professor Pollett is good. The material itself is hard.Lots of extra credit to pull your gade up . His exams are hard , but gives you extra credit for it. Final is hard though. Easy to pass this class., He is systematic and well prepared, but with tendency to make the material boring. Challenging assignments but in groups, exams are average in difficulty., This class is a nightmare. It has nothing to do with programming, it is a bunch of totally useless theoretical bullsh*t. They sould change the name of the class to Math-154. If you can get a C- in this class then you are a genious. His lectures are annoying...he can\t talk properly...all he says is um um um...ok., Very organized and heavily streamlined class.  Mediocre presentation (I counted one lecture--he had an average of one um or uh every 6 seconds!).  That said, the assignments are challenging and instructive and he is a mite hard on grading exams.  He\s not horrible, and has potential for being really great with a bit more work on presentation., Lectures consist of material copied right out of the book. Homework must be done in LATEX typesetting format and question as is most of the material for the class is VERY abstract. Grading is even worse. Answers must be in the exact language that he wants, which is basically plagerising the book. Any partial credit given is not nearly noticeable., Great professor. His classs emphasized on HWs, usually 40%. Lots of extra credits to improve ur grade. Never went to his class much due to work but still doing very well by just going over study guide on his website. Very patient with questions in person and emails. Highly recommnded!, his lecture style bored me.  his assignments take up a lot of time.  the exams and the final were easy, though., Definately take this prof for every class you can. He has a great curve and grading scale, cuz he puts more emphasis on HW rather than exams. With other teachers if u screw up an exam you are finished, but Pollet cares more about hw, which is good cuz his HW are challlenging, but u learn a lot from doing them and they can be fun. Overall a cool guy, Midterms are easy.  Final very difficult.  Lecture pure boredom.  Dudes very lazy., Homeworks take too much time and are not really related to the Object-Oriented subject. His teaching style is basically making slides that are quotes from the book (with typos) and reading the slides in class. Seems like a waste of time. Can drive you nuts with his eh-ah-ooh that he keeps saying between every two words., Good job teaching class. Material gets a bit dry while covering SQL language. Gives examples of theoretical stuff. Exams arent hard but do require some memorization of code, which sucks. Grader was decent and quick. Organized in how he posts powerpoint slides for lectures to his site, which just contain info from the book. Book is effective., good in teaching and grading, I had pollet for game programming. TAKE THIS CLASS if you like games. The text was dry at times, and sometimes the lectures were too. But overall Pollet is excited about games, and will give you good tips to definitely help you understand how games are put together. At firs the framework is a bit daunting but Pollet does a good job of explaining it, Very fun class, but so much to cover in so little time so clarity in the lectures will be superficial, READ THE TEXT. More than a crash course in C++ will be needed or you will have a hard time. Very approachable, go to him with any questions outside of class, especially on the final projects. Will write letters of recommendation on a good grade., lectures are boring, uses dried up makers so you cant read what he writes, and stands in front of it. Posts solutions to practice tests late, like one day before the test, irresponsible. ambiguous questions on exams. takes a fun subject and make it uninteresting., hotty, No Comments, His teaching style is a little boring. But you can still learn from his class. Homework and midterms are reasonable, not easy, not hard. Very nice guy. Always willing to help., Hardest class youll EVER take.  He is a nice guy but the material is very demanding.  Plan on spending all your spare time trying to decipher the material."
Ali Arsanjani,/professor/2439205,4.3,95%,3.7,"He has experience in his field and also in teaching. He is committed to teaching and he is reachable at any time. Dont be afraid to reach him for help., One of the best Professors in my entire masters journey. He has in-depth knowledge of ML. He guides in the right direction for any problem. The assignment focuses on learning concepts he thought. I would recommend taking the ML course with this professor., He definitely answers any of the queries over slack through out the week. And dont just have to wait for office-hours., He is an amazing professor with great industry experience. His practical teaching approach helps us to learn more easily. He is easily available outside the classroom to provide more knowledge and patiently clears doubts., The Professors way of teaching the ML concepts is really good.

He makes students work hard for the grade, which is a good thing., He teaches ML in depth using various projects and homework which make you understand the subject very well., The professor is very responsive. Any time you have a question, just ask. No matter how stupid the question may be, the professor will answer you patiently. Task sometimes could be very abstract and thus could be hard. Just try to do things that come up in your mind. If thats wrong, he will guide you base on that., Great class, but lots of homework., Great class from someone whos had a lot of experience in the industry! Homework does take quite a bit of effort if you have no ML background but hes a generous grader as long as he sees that you put in effort., Prof Arsanjani is excellent. His class is interactive of sorts. Weekly Standups on the projects you are working on. Easily approachable outside the class., Like his approach of teaching. His classes are very hands-on. Need to spend some time and effort but I would say it is worth it., I enjoyed classes from professor a lot. Liked his approach to teach based on ongoing projects. This gives a lot of clarity and helps in understanding concepts as we can directly relate each technique and concept with ongoing project and see the practical applications. Also professor is approachable outside class to understand concepts deeper., Lectures are engaging and lots of discussion happens in the class. Professor always ensures that we understand the topic., Professor is very good. He always new ideas. But the deadline is not reasonable all the time. But overall he is very helpful and approachable., Its really good that professor points us to many links which are really useful., Overall had a good experience.

You have to be in charge of your own learning, and hes there to guide., Good Professor, Professor provides reference articles to students for all topics. He is accessible even after the class and gives good feedback., Very practical course, Good lectures., Hes been the best till now in such an online learning environment. Hes generous , gives personal attention to his students and is always available on slack to solve doubts. He personally helped me catch up with the coursework adjusting with remote work culture and gain back the momentum solving ML complex problems. Highly recommended. Thumbs up., Professor Ali brings to the table his immense professional experience along with academics and I really learned a lot from his lectures and mentoring sessions. His assignments contain reading work that provide additional insights to the lessons learned in classroom and there is also a lot of hands-on learning involved., CMPE257-Machine Learning : since he is in industry, he has a good view of where ML currently is in Industry Acceptance. class will be good if you are looking for application specific ML course this is for it. Dont expect research or math heavy stuff. Irrespective of COVID-19 your classes will be mostly online., He makes more practical touch to all theoretical understanding. His explanations on how to approach new datasets are really helpful to solve Kaggle problem. NLP lectures are giving me confidence to solve language processing problems. He is accessible outside class hours and gives guidance to project all through the term., I liked this class. Professor wants you to learn practical skills with good examples from different articles. Exams like an interview task: given a dataset, you need to try diff models and produce results. He explain everything in a simple way , it is very easy to understand., Professor is always accessible outside of class, It was really a nice experience to get to learn from Professor Ali., It was a very nice learning experience. He included lot of on hands exercises, which provides a deeper insight into the subject., Gives good feedback, accessible outside class anytime, and amazing lectures., Great lectures!, Good, He is seriously the best <3, I like his teaching style, no pressure on students and hes so caring whenever you need help, hes available and just ping him on Slack. I was new in using Stack and now I like it. He explains Machine Learning in an easy-to-understand way. His focus is on our class projects that I like it because we can learn by doing ML projects in a team., I personally didnt like the teaching style at all, 80% of the class he focuses on slack(slack obsession) and medium articles and actually doesnt teach anything. Gives heavy home work, and then asks us to apply what we learned from homework on the project we are doing. Completely un organized!!I wouldnt suggest him.i didnt learn anything new-0%, Lot of learning and get ready for lot of work based on industry project., It was an awesome learning experience with Dr Arsanjani . I got to learn different aspect of of Machine Learning concepts. He was always available to clarify the doubts even outside the class. I am glad that we got the opportunity to learn from him., Great professor with good industrial experience in the field. His mentoring sessions are really helpful in getting the complete insights about the machine learning concepts and helped in better understanding of the use-case and solving them., Usage of practical examples or demo in class could help in understanding concepts., Dr Arsanjani is a nice professor. He provides hands-on assignments which is the right way of learning. The entire course was filled with a great learning experience. Definitely recommend his class., explains the complicated concepts clearly. knowledgeable instructor. learn a lot from Dr. Arsanjani, Dr. Arsanjani is an awesome instructor. He is very\xa0knowledgable and inspiring. He always encourages students, responsive, and communicates things in a clear way. His course material was really interesting, he ensured students to grasp most of the concepts. The assignments were challenging and it helped me learn a lot., Very practical approach in teaching.

Very motivating Class. Current edge technologies awareness., Great experience on having the class with Professor Ali, hes very knowledgeable and respectful to all of the students, always ready to answer any question in and after class., Quite disorganized with respect to assignment expectations, deadlines and even portals where they need to be submitted. Grading policy was not clear(you dont get scores for slack). Assignments lead to projects, even if you get full scores in assignments the same consolidated into project submission yields low score with no feedback from professor., Great Professor, Makes you do lots of machine learning exercises which is enough to clear your concept and practical on subject matter ! Recommended !!, Sets high expectations, tough for beginners. His industrial exposure greatly helps in understanding the concepts. Clear grading criteria, but does not provide feedback., He introduced us to real world examples of application of machine learning. This has been very useful., * Industry oriented learning rather than theoretical or maths for the Machine Learning course * Available to clarify doubts even outside the class, I gained a good understanding of not only applying ml algorithms but also understanding the overall story that algorithms are trying to explain. Having said that the class topics are not in flow and first topic is not related to the next. Also classes are little light on technical examples., Prof. Ali Arsanjani has helped to provide clear understanding of Machine Learning concepts., Great professor with deep experience in the field. I am really glad that we had the opportunity to learn from him this semester."
Cay Horstmann,/professor/78821,3.0,20%,3.9,"It was the first time that he taught CS 146 in the past Spring semester,2019. Exams were so hard. If you want to pass cs146, I dont recommend his class., This is his first time teaching so hes still rusty on data structures & algorithms. Uses Dr. Taylors system, although he tweaks it (i.e. midterms are spread out throughout semester and extends deadlines for assignments). Very open to questions and willing to help you out. Make sure you know every algorithm in and out! Youll be tested on that, He has the philosophy of student can read HIS book, so no lecture. Class time are labs that he doesnt grade, but expect u to do it as parts of them on exam. Lab rarely have all instruction needed. Lab solution? Have to copy as fast as he type. 90% grading done by script, pts off per test case(unknown till graded)fail. 1 time consuming HW per week., Vague! As someone on Piazza and here said. He literally does not describe in enough detail what he wants. Its one thing to ask students to research and not know all the answers. Its another to not provide enough HW info on WHAT. Only finished 2.5/5 questions on exam. Grades JavaDoc on EVERYTHING. Have to calc our grades from Github., the worst teacher in my life, he thinks the course is tougher and you learn more. he is smart but not good at teaching. If you have question, he wants you to post on Piazza., Didnt teach and just expect us know everything he wrote on his own book. All he wants is publishing his book and didnt come to class for 5 times now. PLZ save your college life by not taking him., Closer to a 3.5 than a 4. Easily the hardest CS class Ive taken at SJSU, difficulty is higher than both CS 146 and 155. Homework will take around 5 hours per assignment initially and will ramp up to 20ish per assignment. IF YOU DO TAKE THIS CLASS YOU WILL COME OUT FAR MORE CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND EXECUTE IN NEW LANGUAGES., Lowsy professor., Very good professor, I only have a recommend that adding more exams!! More exams can let us get better grades., He is super smart but does not teach effectively. It takes me hours to understand his assignments, you can never finish his tests ( miss atleast one big question). The only way to sanely pass with a B ish grade is do really good on the HWs which are often graded so weirdly. His grading rubric is designed so javadoc bring you down 20% on the hw., I didnt like him as a teacher overall. Theres a lot of things he needed to improve on as a teacher. However, I learned a lot in this course and it actually will help for 146. His grading system is very generous. I HIGHLY suggest you do VERY WELL in HW in this class. It will honestly save your grade. Also, this class is a LOT of work. So be ready., Since the class is almost 200 students, it is difficult to expect him to be there to help everyone. You need to self-study a lot of the materials in this class. For beginners, make sure you read the book before starting this class because it will be a big jump from CS 46A. However, I learned a lot from his class and his textbook., I dont recommend his class. As some other people said, he expected students to finish homework before his lecture. His homework is EXTREMELY challenging. Thats true the class is graded on curve. But there are some students who have experienced on programming, and even professional programmer from open college. So it is incredibly hard to get A., You will learn from him, BUT you will risk failing his class and probably one more of your other class, He is a tough professor for a beginner programmer. When he assigns homework, he sometimes gets really vague on what he wants done which can make the problems harder. Midterms are tough but, he curves it based on the result of the whole class. Its a hard class but at the same time, I felt like I learnt quite a lot from his class., He is one of the worst teacher I ever took. He assumes all students are pro in data structure. Literally you have to solve his assignment before prof starts giving lecture otherwise its really challenging to finished it. His homework in a week includes 2 quiz, and 3 programming assignment ( draft and final). If youre taking his class be aware!!!, Cay is a really great professor. He made sure to answer everyones questions on Piazza, which most professors do not do. His instructions for homework are vague, but he is always there to help so long as you ask. I feel as though his assignments were more practical than the other professors. I would highly recommend him!, The name of the class was Intro to Programming. There is nothing intro about this course. I\m talking 20-25 hours a week if you want an A, and that\s just on Homework and Labs, not including Studying. Instructions were often vague in a class where instructions are incredibly crucial. In all, I strongly do not recommend this class., DO NOT take his class if you are a first time programmer. It will be a living nightmare! He knows his stuff, but just is a very bad teacher who isnt clear in directions and on assignments., very disorganized. Directions for work are extremely vague and unhelpful. The code he uses for labs and homeworks is extremely buggy and rarely works the way he says. You are expected to know a lot of android development already, despite the pre-reqs being 46A and 47. Dont take this class unless you have tons of free time and experience!, very disorganized. Directions for work are extremely vague and unhelpful. The code he uses for labs and homeworks is extremely buggy and almost never works the way he says. You are expected to know a lot of android development already, despite the pre-reqs being 46A and 47. Dont take this class unless you have tons of free time and experience!, If you are a first time Java student, dont take him. If youre experienced in programming prior to the class, he should be easy. It was really hard for the first time programmers to grasp everything because he wasnt organized and a book that he wrote was too confusing., First few labs were dedicated to forcing his OS and text editor preferences on the students (lubuntu and emacs), its a waste of class time that could be spent learning the actual material. He knows enough about Java to teach, but there isnt much beyond that and his OS politics (like its 1995)., Hes a pretty good teacher, You dont have to go to class, but you have to participate during class which can be done at home. The class is easy as long as you do all HW and labs without cheating. Basically if you can stay on a computer for long periods of time, and your logical, (the basics of a CS major) then you pass the class with flying colors., 2 out of class, open book online quizzes each week.\n Long hard exams, generously curved. 3 challenging hws weekly. Concise lectures with multiple clicker questions. Labs after class. Employs every conceivable tactic to get u to think, learn. Lots of snafus. A bumpy, painful, stressful, fantastic learning experience!, I went in with an open mind, and tried to like this prof. But he is not well prepared and unorganized. I have to check EVERY hw, and quiz for grading mistakes, I find them often. His exams have egregious mistakes, and are poorly run. His attitude is not defensive, but he is never apologetic. Clearly 46B is low priority for him. Very disappointing., It is obvious that in his mind he knows the material, but he is the most disorganized professor I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach, and his slides are completely useless. I did not learn one thing in his course, and it was a complete waste of money. Dont take his class if you want to learn., He knows what hes talking about, which is also his downfall teaching. He teaches like everyone knows what hes talking about even if they dont. Asking him questions doesnt really help either. Do the homework and practice a lot. He assigns the homework before he explains the material. Not good for first time Java learners., At first, I thought his class was good. However, it turned out to be stressful because we are having labs two days a week. There are no demonstrations about showing how a class is formed., DO good on the Hw like 80 percent, get a C and Ds on the Exams. Get a like B on the group  project you pass the class. Try your best dont quit.!!!! Be active Participate!! Try to learn! Go to class/labs even though its waste of time. TRYYYYYYYY TO LEARN., He wrote the book the class is based on and thinks that his book is so good he does not need to teach/lecture or help at all. His HW is strait from the book and is fairly challenging and only gets harder. Being in class is the worst thou because he does not teach a word and expects us to know the material perfectly. Highly Not Recommend., Would not recommend this teacher for first time java students. He doesnt teach anything in class. He expects students to learn by reading his textbook. Helps students if they have questions but doesnt go over a single homework problem in class, which are very hard., Not Really Helpful. Not a recommended Professor for students learning java for the first time. Does not explain anything in class, very little. Doesnt go over the homework problems in class. Expects students to learn by reading the text book, which is written by him. IF you dont understand him then you wont under stand the textbook. :), Overall he\s a decent teacher if you ask him with specific questions for help. Sometimes he can be really confusing because he doesn\t really explain unless you know what you dont know (odd right?) Don\t expect to learn through lectures, but expect to learn through the labs., You need to work really hard for this subject. Grades exactly as you have worked. Responds to email as quick as he can. But be sure to ask him sensible questions. No group homework. So dont rely on other people., Smart guy and funny too.  Only problem is that he gives way too much work.  Expect to spend several days on his HW assignments.  His exams are hard but he curves., Cay Horstmann is the James Bond of Computer Science., Professor Horstmann is the ONLY reason I choose SJSU CS vs others. What he taught still echos in my daily life as a software engineer. By taking his class I achieved more than I could have been without it. Look beyond the textbooks, guys...., Cay Horstmann is arguably the rock star professor for the CS department, and with good reason.  His command of the material is particularly impressive and he knows how to draw material together nicely.  This particular 185C section was on open-source software and is highly recommended., Pure genius. Horstmann is the guru of CS. If you want to succeed in the real world, this is the professor to take., The class is too hard compared to the alternatives. Unlike what the previous person said, his class is not close to real work environment, so this should not be a reason to take his class. He is a good teacher but he seems to assume that this is the only class you take and loads you accordingly. Take Tseng., His 160 class is about as close to the real-world work environment experience as you are ever going to get in a school setting.  If you have no prior work exp in s/w dev, the practical skills and experience youll gain in the class are well worth the effort you are bound to put into it., Expects you to check e-mail and online green sheet daily as hell change due dates or change the assignment without telling you in class. Lectures use same examples as book which arent the greatest. Slides are the same as in the book no help there. Easy grader. Curves. Download source code for his book from his website., One of the BEST CS prof there is at SJSU.  His exams and projects are never easy, but his lectures are plain great--straight to the point and easy to understand.  You will learn loads in his class., lots of programming assignments and expects a lot from students., Dr. Horstmann is awesome. Very well organized, and concise lecture. You can learn essence of CS like refactoring, automation, unit testing and design pattern. I have also taken CS152 with him. Those classes have brought me into next level. I even got a full-time Software engineer job right after the classes. I would love to take him with again....., This professor is awesome. His lectures are very concise. He has a sense of humor too. I wish there were more professors like him at SJSU. If you just want to pass the class, take Lees and speak Chinese with him. LOL, If you really like programming, take his class. If you dont like coding, avoid him by all means.He is the best and toughest guy in CS dept., I did learn alot when I was in his class., Expect to spend 20+ hours a week on homework for this class.  Youll have an assignment due every two weeks, and each will take about 40-50 hours to code.  That being said, great teacher!  Very well organized, very clear.  The textbook for the course is o, Hard homework and midterm, but both are fair enough for this class. Interesting class, you will learn a lot from him., You HAVE to take 151 from this guy. I mean, he *wrote the book* on java. Good organization of lectures, clear explanation of complex topics. Hard homeworks, easy midterms., Learn a lot in his class.  Great teacher, Probably the most educated and well trained CS teacher at SJSU. overall good, Homework is easy, but time consuming. Midterms are extremelly difficult., bad, hard midterms"
Renee Fecteau,/professor/4455,3.7,100%,3.2,"She is really cool! And I loved taking her CS class but it was a bit boring., Chicken scratch handwriting and a thick accent, I couldnt even follow her to save my life!  She is one of the reasons I dropped out of CS!, took her unix class. she is a great teacher and her test is fair., I dropped out of SJSU because of her. Not only she doesnt know how to teach, she will literally demolish your interest/confidence/life in CS with her harsh coursework and grading. I can expect this kind of workload in an UC campus, not in MacQuarrie Hall., She had clear, precise, and organized notes. Always prepared for class. Very presentable and clean cut. She is tough, but fair. I learned more in her than posibbly all of my classes put together. I took her for CS147 as well. I LOVE HER!!!!!, She sucked., Pretty ****y when it comes to being critical about programs and test questsions, but she knows what shes talking about. I probably could have done a lot better if I didnt have the class right after 3 hours of Humanities., She is a very good teacher., FECTEAU IS FREAKIN AWESOME.. too bad shes retiring =(, Yeah, shes a little quirky (overly dramatic), but I prefer that over the boring droning typical to a comp sci prof. She knows her stuff; class doesnt require you to read extra info from a text because there is no textbook, just class notes/handouts. Recommended. Assignments are straightforward., GOd this Teacher is a B****!!! She is mean, and not helpful at all! If you go to her office hours, she will find some reason to yell at you so you dont even feel comfortable asking a question! shez so unfair! gradez bad! Old crank! shouldnt even be teaching! Get lost you oldie!, She is a good professor. At least, she knows how to program. A lot of professors at SJSU do not know how to program. I cannot believe., As a teacher she is good but as a person ... Not a nice one to talk to., She is one of the best. Good and clear examples. Her notes are very organized and you will learn a lot in her classes., Highly recommended, Great teacher! Gave good examples and taught exactly what she tested on., excellent teacher for CS 140 which sets the foundation for CS 147 . i began to love assembly programming after learning with her . very systematic, great class notes , exams that challenge you without killing you . You need to study regularly though else you can slip your grade ., one of the best instructors i ever had at sjsu. and i didnt have many. smart person, fair and super fast in grading, and very clear on lecture. listen to the lecture and ull get A. the other ****s who did bad it was becuz they suck. shes not hard at all, but if ur dumb or lazy, dont take her., Fair teacher! Hard class, but she explains things well! Doesnt expect things she didnt teach. Definitely recommended!!!, grades harshly. made a girl cry. NOT recommended., She is a nice teacher and will help you with any problems you might have on the subject.  Only one large programming assignment and tests.  The tests themselves were about average and her lecturing skills are somewhat bland as well., Hard teacher who doesnt teach well -_-, She has no people skills so dont bother asking questions, she gives you whatever grade she wants.  She is below average as a lecturer, tests are mediocre, acts insulted by students that she has to teach an intro class., Mean., She gives you such a great foundation in java programming that i had easier times in my other classes.  By far one of the greatest teachers Ive had so far.  Heard shes not coming back next semester.  Its so unfortunate to lose one of the good teachers., She could come across as rude at times which might deter some students from approaching her for help, but shes actually really helpful during office hrs and she really cares about doing everything she can to teach the material the best way possible., excellent teacher, Im not an easy guy to motivate into doing work, but she does that easily. She teaches in an interesting manner that you will find both informative and helpful as a CS student. Very clear with her lectures and what she expects from you., Very clear on what needs to be done. Very helpful website with leacture notes that will save your life., I have taken 2 classes with her. She was horrible but has gotten better on the 2nd class. Her teaching material is great and grading seems pretty fair. However, i think she is rude and unapproachable becuz of her moodiness., Horrible teacher, She was a great teacher.  Her assignments will make you learn a lot and she has an interesting attitude. Keep up on the assignments and the tests will be easy and youll get an A., She is amzing!I just feel so glad that I took this course under her.Her course is really organized and well prepared.Even her assignments build on what she teaches in class.She is excellent!, If you want to learn, take this teacher!  Shes great and her programs are challenging but it pays off for CS majors.  Take her class!, Unfair.. Very frustated., HARD, Well organized online notes, though she didnt spend much time on lecture in classroom. You can learn very well by practicing those hands-ons from her website. Remember to do all the assigment, tests and exam are fair., Clear lecture and notes, very interesting intonation. She explains deeply for those important and hard concepts of programming. Fair exams, acceptable program assignment. Good professor over all. If you really want to learn, take her!, No good.  Yells at students when they ask questions.  Has no people skills at all.  She gets frustrated when students dont understand concepts., A lot of hard programming assignment and homework...picky person..hard n strict marking test...not free during office hour...talk lots of non sense about C programming while teaching Java ...stupid idiot !, Shes a great prof. Her notes are awesome and very well organized. You dont really need to get the book., She is tough, but knows the material very well. She goes through the material fast so it is absolutely imperative that you go to her class every day., A good teacher., Great knowledge . Knows her subject very well and in a clear fashion . Very systematic . Very picky about small things like the correct submission folder and correct comments ., Clear lecture. Prepare to learn a lot. Picky about program structure., clear lectures, not so picky about programs as long as it runs correctly, Good teacher, but prepare to work hard., Assembler tests very hard; Grades programs very strictly, Very helpfule during office hours. Clear lecture"
Fabio Di Troia,/professor/2116397,4.2,86%,3.1,"Probably one of the best CS professors Ive ever had. Hes a really caring professor and gives every student equal amounts of time they need in office hours. If you are scared of Machine Learning and learning it, he makes it very easy to understand. He emphasizes understanding the process rather than memorizing, which makes the subject approachable, (25% each) 2 MT, 1 Final, HW. Content itself was very conceptual. Just ask the right questions to understand protocols thoroughly & the rest isnt difficult. Highly recommend attending lecture, he records but examples on board arent shown. Prof is probably the nicest/most fun Ive had, very approachable for help. Also gave EC to help students out., Awesome professor. You dont need to find online videos to understand concepts, his lecture and notes are good enough to excel exams. Attendance is not mandatory but recommended. Gives extra credit if class average is low. Exams carry high weight for overall grade., All-around fantastic professor! Lectures well at a decent pace and is always willing to help. Material wasnt hard to understand except for HMM maybe. Never felt overwhelmed with the workload for this class. Midterms and final were in the form of projects. Really appreciated that he had 1-1 office hours instead of lectures during midterm weeks., The material we learned was very hard, but Fabio did a great job simplifying it for us. Always checked to see if we understood what was going on. Workload was VERY manageable (4 HW, 2 midterm projects, final project). Usually ended class 5-10 min early which was nice. Recorded lectures too. I only wish he had clear grading rubrics for projects tho., He goes over the material with nice pacing. As long as you attend all lectures, which do not feel boring at all, you should be able to easily pass the class. If you want to score high grades, you do need to actively participate (ask questions) when its necessary. The tests are completely relevant to what is covered in lecture., Fabios great! Knowledgable and very responsive to questions. It was a pleasure to work with him., Great class! More emphasis on safe/good programming conventions than on getting correct output. Fairly easy assignments that help with midterms and final, which are projects. Very helpful in office hours and will help debug your code. Records lectures and lets class out 15 min early. I only wish he had clear grading rubrics on Canvas though., Amazing! Clear/concise lectures that are recorded so you can watch them later. Very responsive to questions and ends class 15 min early! 6 HWs in the form of a Canvas quiz with unlimited time. Open note exams with a few tricky questions. He curves exam grades though and also shares last semesters exams so we know what kinds of questions to expect., Fabio is very knowledgeable about information security and always there to help students. His lectures are well-prepared, very easy to follow, fun and enjoyable., Cant teach basic concepts. Rushes a lot and skip over important material. The most important part is left to the student :) AVOID, The concepts taught are pretty tough, but Fabio offers plenty of support both in and out of class: responsive to questions and emails, approachable, and friendly. Exams are of moderate difficulty. Occasional exam curves. Generous extra credit., Loved him! Super chill, a great sense of humor, and very responsive to emails. Two midterms and a final, all of which are projects., Very unclear in explaining the topic. Does not answer clearly to emails either. Nice guy though, but cant teach, Professor Fabio was super nice, super knowledgeable, very lenient, and his primary focus was helping students learn and understand instead of punish through grades. I loved how his lectures were engaging and he incorporated humor to keep everyone interested, his assignments were directly relevant to what we were learning, So you know, this class is a project-based class and half the class is asynchronous. - Kinda straightforward lectures, but with many pauses - slow at grading but lenient enough - receive a course grade but when he did not post our final project scores. MUST know python (with sklearn) before taking ML. pros: 1-hr lecture, turns out to be good., Professor Di Troia is amazing. His lectures are very engaging and informative. I thoroughly enjoyed his InfoSec class. It was not an easy class, and you have to work for it, but it is highly interesting and rewarding., Avoid, Helpful class. He shared lots of conventions and good habits for web servers and coding in general. Easy assignments but enhance what he taught in class. They help tremendously in midterm and final projects. Can put on resume something from this class. Wish SJSU have more web classes, not just backend just frontend too., I mean if you have to check Fabios reviews on RMP to look for opinions, are you even a CS student at SJSU? No doubt best CS prof at SJSU. Very knowledgable, hands out amazing lectures, shares lots of tips and interesting stories related to InfoSec. But there are so many students competing for questions and help so dont take this class alone., HES SO NICE. Theres no midterm / finals exams, just projects (and he was super lenient with extending their due dates when asked). He keeps his lectures interesting, is pretty fun, and is overall great. Tough class but awesome guy :), Fabio is very understanding with everybodys time and grade but do not go into this class expecting an easy A. This class is mostly project-based and Fabio does not hold your hand on projects. The assigned projects are at a level you would expect of master students. StackOverflow will not help you with this class, you need to be able to code well., Not recommended at all!, Horrible, avoid him at all costs. he has no regards for students. Dos not answer email to clarify questions. He can not teach, The worse instructor Ive ever had!!! He doesnt check his emails on purpose and when you ask him about answers and grades after 3 weeks, he has no reason to provide. He is just giving grades emotionally!! He doesnt even know how to answer some questions! Honestly you will learn nothing from his lectures because he is not a lecturer!, I LOVE Fabio, but for some reason, he stopped answering emails for 185C students asking for clarification by email. I took him for 166 also & hes AMAZING. There was just so much crammed into this class (ML, AI, HMM, SVM, KNN) that many of us got lost. His lectures are INCREDIBLE, learned a lot, but way too much content and huge final/MT projects., One of my fav CS classes Ive ever taken. His grading criteria are clear and he basically gives you all the info in the slides. Hes funny and lets us out 15 mins early every lecture without making you feel like you didnt learn anything., Really enjoyed taking his class, He does a great job of explaining things in class, so be sure to attend when you can, as hell also skip over some stuff on the slides. A couple of homework assignments (easy Canvas quizzes), but grade is mostly based on the 2 midterms and final., I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR. HONESTLY!!! THE BEST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD!! I took another one of his course (CS166) the following semester and even started working for him. I absolutely recommend this professor to any student (grad/undergrad). His lectures are very interesting and on to the point. I love how he uses his time wisely., This class is not easy to begin with. Basically learning how to code medium projects. 2 group midterm projects and solo final project. Weekly homework assignments, most are easy, just need a day to finish. Tough midterms and final tho, especially when you work with clowns. Fabio is hella smart, chill guy and everyone loves him. Take his class!, The professor is one of the coolest in the CS dept. I took this as a graduate elective, and keep wishing that I could take more classes with him! Lectures are easy and final projects are interesting, where you choose your level but hell grade fairly. He is focused on security of web applications, and gets you interested in it too., The class is graded in 4 sections of 25% each, so really make sure you dont mess up on the midterms or miss a hw. Fabio is a security expert in explaining the concepts; I personally found the class pretty confusing if you dont go, so I highly recommend it. Midterms and final are all online. Class was pretty interesting material. Amazing professor, Super chill guy, good sense of humor. Material is very straight forward and for the class project you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want and he will grade it fairly. This is an awesome elective choice and can either be an easy A (if you decide to pick an easy project) or an awesome resume builder if you pick a harder project., Fabio is a legend., This is one of the most difficult major class for computer science and believe me this guy would try his best to make the subject as easy as possible for you guys. You have to study but overall the professor is amazing., He is one of the best professors I have encountered in my classes at SJSU. He is really helpful and willing to make students learn the subject. I have taken 2 other classes with him and the response from those are the same. The projects he assigns each semester are really worth working for to show off on your resume., Extra credit helps a lot, Fabio cares about his students. If you ask for help, he will get back to you asap. Many complained about the exam being too hard though. Records his own lectures to youtube if you ask him to. I want to take him for every class I can now. His grading criteria can be a bit unclear though, and a small deduction can drop your grade quite a bit., Professor Fabio is one of the best professors I have taken a course with at San Jose State. He teaches really well and explains all of the important information to the students. His slides contain all the information you will need and are very thorough. I would definitely take another class with him., Fabio is pretty smart and fun to listen to, always backs up for clarification when needed. Will sometimes boost everyones test scores if class average is below passing. Very little work, however every point counts if you want an A. Tests are sometimes graded oddly (3 points for a multiple choice, vs 2 for short answer) so be careful., Laid back, very knowledgeable. Wants people to pass his class. Good slides. He keeps lectures short and sweet., I took his 152 in Spring 2016. I really recommend everyone to take his class. 1. He replies emails really fast. 2. Lecture is short but detailed. 3. HWs/Tests are not difficult and he gave extra points Note: for the extra points, they count directly into final grade. In my case, I only need to have 30/100 for my final to get an A at the end...., Didnt learn anything from the teacher. Had to call him on some errors in his tests, and what is good practice and not. Still dont know anything more about this topic than I did going into the class. He is there to help after his 30min lecture, but google is better However, the tests are easy and fair. An easy A class if you review slides and hw., 30 mins lecture. Attendance is not mandatory.  No programming assignments. You will have multiple HW assignments on canvas usually 10 questions out of which 7 are multiple choice and 3 are short answers with unlimited time. There will be tests that are timed. If you read the slides and attend lecture, you will be fine., Best I have ever had! For this class, everything goes with the slides, study it means passing the class. He is nice and always accessible. He is willing to answer your question. He even helped me with stuff from my other class. The grading is fair enough.  I would definitely take him again if have the chance!, Great teacher. Keeps his lectures short and uses the time after lecture for questions. The homework can be a bit tricky if you dont attend the lecture. If you study the slides well enough though you will do fine. His tests are based upon his homework assignments and the slides. The final was very straight forward and fair. Great teacher., Lectures are fairly vague and always ended about 30 minutes early (good bc less time spent at lecture and bad bc it wasnt engaging enough and were fast-paced). Never found his lectures helpful bc the material is straightforward if you read book and slides. Gave canvas hw and likely accessible for 1-on-1 help when needed., For most questions you get the answer Don\t worry. Tests are all based on his slides, no book needed."
Chris Tseng,/professor/213630,2.3,40%,3.1,"Professor Tseng is a nice dude. Generally speaking, the course itself is not terribly difficult to survive through. Just do the work, have a good group for the group project, and you should be okay. These other reviews seem pretty accurate in terms of what the course layout is like and the final project. Pretty chill overall, no complaints from me., 1st half of the semester, he lectures on project management, agile/scrum, etc. with easy weekly hw. Second half is team project which is using a CMS to build a website. He doesnt grade anything as other teams grade your project milestones and TA grades hw and final milestone. Project EC is determined by participation in your teams discord server., The class is supposed to be software project, but he teaches scrum and agile for the first half of the semester and then gives a useless tool to make a website that a 5 year old could do as well. Doesnt grade anything himself, the other groups grade you. Midterm and final are mcq, but they are super confusing and super difficult to get good marks., The professors instructions are vague. He gives assignments that could have several correct answers but only gives you a good grade if they are answers that he likes. This class is like hoping to learn to drive by just reading the DMV handbook without ever driving. You wont learn to be a better software engineer from learning the material., Material is good, but professor is monotone and makes it very difficult to listen in class. Goes on random tangents which makes it hard to follow the lecture. Grading is very unclear, we were graded on participation for group project and it seem like it was determined based on how many messages you wrote on your groups discord server... Very picky, His lectures are pointless. He goes over a lot of topics but, those topics feel like busy work. His assignments are easy. Dont expect to learn much from this class. The project is about making a dynamic website but, we are not really making a website. We use a tool called Drupal that does all the work. We just provide the content of the website., Its weird. The first part of the semester, youre just learning about some vague stuff on software development stages. Therre will be a couple homework assignments that are easy. But the problem is the group project. The project is about making dynamic website, yet we never learn about how to make one. Lecture is random rambling on CS151 topic., Professor Tseng gives great feedback. You will have homework every week but if you pay attention in class, you will get a 100/100 easily. There is 1 mid term and 1 final and a group project. Lectures are recorded and are available the entire semester. He is a very good grader so dont worry about grades., Good material, bad explanation. Hes really hard to understand, partially because of his English, but mostly due to the way the explain things. He jumps from one point to another in the code (using search terms), making it impossible to follow the logic. Doesnt really give feedback to what youre doing wrong., Took him over winter session for 46a, overall the class was very fast paced but he tried to catch us up whenever possible. He did not always explain information to the fullest but he did provide links for us to read later on. He also put a high emphasis on certain topics (sometimes telling us what would be on the exams) to assist the students., He read slides to us about agile and program management. Does a couple of online classes with HTML and JSON. But 2/3 of the class is the projects, and his grading rubric is the stupidest thing ever. Its based on what the other group rated you as and what your peer grade you as. The FINAL PROJECT is 30% of your grade (everyone got 90-100). Stresful, Dont take him for 160 or 174 unless youre taking a 1-class semester for some reason. His project has confusing directions and will overlap with finals week to make both his class and other classes harder to pass., Unhelpful tbh. He expects you to know the material by heart. Within 2 weeks he covered 6 chapters!!! Don\t take him, his hw assignments are nerve wracking, plus the TA grades unfairly. His guidelines for the class project are extremely vague, more than half the time I\m confused about what to do. I woulda taken someone else if available., Do the homework and your final project as those two are the biggest parts of your grade. His tests are tricky, but you can always make up the points by doing bonus homework assignment. Final group project for CS161 is the biggest factor of your grade and beware of choosing partners because you cant change them. Overall the class it tolerable., Huge emphasis on a group project.  Professor was rude and degrading.  He argued with the group in front of the class and interrupted us on several occasions.  He told us we needed to be better without providing any feedback on how.  A third party reviewed our project in class and loved it.  Professor told us to fix it with no direction., It is interesting class. But, class subject and project is hard. Grading was ok, but you might need to study hard!, I am skeptical if he even knows how to program. He doesnt actually teach anything in his class and just throw projects at you. He has a huge ego and a bad accent, its very hard to stay awake in his class. But if you do all the work... youll pass the class whilst learning nothing., This guy in intolerable. Most irritating professor of SJSU & always blame students for his mistake. Keeps forgetting about what he has to teach in class. Complete package of TimePass. Arrogant, Irritating, unbearable, dumb professor of SJSU & should be sacked for wasting students money on his course., Worst worst worst ... n times. No clarity at all. Directs frustration on students. Dnt waste your time and money all. I dont understand why SJSU has such useless professors., Worst professor I have evern seen in my entire life. No Clarity at all. always confused. alway threatens to fail, Despite its name Big data analytics the course did not touch on big data at all. We spoke of XML and JSON and reviewed commercial software for log analysis. We did NOT discuss anything even closely related to big data such as sharding strategies and map-reduce., This guy is abusive. He often threatens to take off 25-50% of your all your points for things he did not specify (e.g. EXACT naming convention) or are outside of your control (HIS server not accepting file uploads for half the time between work assigned and due). He doesnt put effort in the class and directs his frustration at students., If you want to learn something relevant please avoid this class. 50% of material is already covered in CS151(prereq). Lectures are as boring as they get. He seems to be unable to present material without using his slides (Thanks I can read slides myself). Homework is designed for special ed students. Uninspiring, utterly boring and insulting., 1st half of semester were fed mindless and useless homework. 2nd part of semester is focused on team project. Descriptions of project assignments are vague. Book is almost unused. Only 4 chapters were covered. Grading is questionable. Meet 1 day a week + 3 furloughs (total 15 meetings). Easy class, but very little value. Avoid at all costs., His class is alright. As long as you do the work and is a good contributor to your group, you should be good. Watch out for group members that dont do anything. Youll have to pick up the slack from them because he makes the class like real world work. One midterm, so do good on that. Majority of hw is doing reports, which he is really big on., cryptic grading scheme that relies on what you do wrong rather then what you did right. If your answer is not his answer (on open ended questions) you get half credit even if you back up your claims. The final project is about as worthless as they come, where the bulk of the work is in the report, not your project. Easiest 160 class, waste of time., This is the professor to take for CS160. The first few months is really easy, made up of straight-forward homework and quizes. But the group project in the final month will make up for it. He was very clear, and explained things well, sometimes making it feel like a lower division class. I ended up using alot of the PHP/SQL programming later on., This class is pretty chill except for the last month where you have to do a group project. Just make sure you have good ppl in your group or you are screwed. Luckily, there is no final, just a midterm. He is a nice guy and shows concern for students. He gives loads of extra credit, especially for the midterm. Overall a great prof and fun class., Very good and helpful teacher. There was plenty of work, including the final project, but it was all directly related to the class material and was very helpful in learning the web stuff., Nice professor, learned a lot about PHP and web design.  Final project was a lot of work.  Is very helpful during office hours and a lenient/understanding grader..i say understanding because we had a very hard grader, but he would give points back when u make the case to him. Overall good professor., He does not know much about programming. His programming skill is suck. But some of CS professors at SJSU are like him.Suck at programming.Always talk about old stuff which they learn at their school. What is CS?, This was the most interesting class of Computer Science. The web application project was very fun to do and an interesting subject to learn which is relevant to todays web applications. Professor Tseng did an excellent job of teaching this class., easy material to study. Project are very userful, however too much pressure. Hes very responsive to all the questions (I got back his answer from email really fast). I learn a lot in his class, No Comments, The worst Prof. He has no clue abt his presence. I wish i could revert back and take another course. Didnot learn a thing.Not a fair grader., He know nothing about programming. His interest is focused on some old, odd, and useless stuff. He never express his idea clearly to me and he is never fair in grading., Great teacher who cares about students knowledges and questions. More pressure on the final exam (2 weeks), but training you in future real work. I started from bare knowledge of HTML,PHP,Apache and MySQL into profiency level just thru this class-Fall 02, Doesnt know anything. Will make u work like crazy on stuff that doesnt make sense. Will be partial in grading scheme. Slippery like an eel. Will slip through even then. This is coming from a 3.7 GPA student. You can still take his class if you wish..."
Dominic Abucejo,/professor/1969051,3.9,77%,2.4,"Great guy, would recommend everyone to take his class. Super knowledgeable in software practices in industry. Hes super chill and as long as you do the work you will get a good grade., CS160 depends on your project, a large chunk of your grade is the term project. Outside of the term project, the midterms and homeworks are very manageable., I took him in-person for 49J. He is very caring and gives 2 in-class activities per week and some assignments too (Zybooks + Canvas). Some quizzes but theyre easy. Midterms and final are on computer (canvas) but in-person. Open notes and homework. Gives extra time for assignments if you ask for help on time., Dominic is a great person who is very flexible with his assignments. If you are struggling, he will help you and even give you more time if necessary. Assignments and course material coincide with exams, so you are tested on what you learn. However, he is a bit disorganized and pushed one of the midterms back three times. Otherwise a good prof., Nice guy. Very easy class. A tad disorganized., Good professor! The class is really chill. He even moved the due dates for assignments a lot of times for us. Exams are easy as well. Though it was advanced C++, the class was much easier than I thought. Take him!, He is a very nice guy, but seemed kind of disorganized. Also took a long time to grade things. The difficulty of quizzes, assignments, etc. felt fair from what was taught in lectures, there were no curveballs. Extended deadlines for several things. Overall, not a bad choice., This course doesn\t really live up to its name Advanced C++. It\s more like Intermediate C++ with a touch of data structures and stuff., He grades nicely but doesnt teach the concepts well. The lecture is just slides and him explaining some code which tends to get boring. You will have to do some studying outside to really understand the concepts. The homework are past assignments from about 4 years ago which you can find online. Overall, a decent professor for an easy grade., Nice guy, I enjoyed this class and honestly didnt find it very hard. He does a decent job of explaining things and was generous when it came to extending deadlines for homework and projects for students that needed the extra time. The only real problem is that sometimes his directions are confusing., Hes really nice but is not a great lecturer, take this class if you want an easy A but dont expect to fully learn any of the concepts. You will have to do a lot of self studying to reinforce what he briefly goes over in class., Nice prof, curved one exam and extended a project deadline. He does lectures, but they are really boring, hard to stay awake. Hws and labs are where the learning happens. TB reading is not required but can be helpful. Overall not a difficult class if you are patient and can self study, Lectures are boring. Not very good at teaching. Sometimes the concepts were taught wrong. I had to attend another professors lecture to actually understand the concepts. The exams were just code where we had to WRITE CODE on PAPER., He is very helpful in terms of really wanting you to learn programming. Explains the concepts well, even to people with zero background in programming at all. This is an entry level class so he definitely gives new student a good foundation to build on in computer science/programming., Very good professor. His lectures are precise, clear and you actually learn new things along the way. Pay attention, learn, enjoy the process and youll get an A. He brings industry experience into the class, which really helps to focus learning into not only gain a strong foundation of java programming but also toward practical job usage., Mr. Abucejo is a great prof. He presents lecture notes via projector and takes the time to explain each slide carefully. He often wrote code on the whiteboard to explain the topics we were learning. He was very generous with partial credit on both midterms and was easy to get a hold of through email. His office hours were really helpful too!, He was too nice. This class was very easy for me because his final exam was open book. Ive never taken higher CS classes with him before, but if hes also being that nice in those classes, people wont learn much. CS is supposedly a tough course, and its not helpful to have easy CS classes especially if you want to be a software developer."
Thomas Austin,/professor/2000580,4.8,100%,3.6,"Austin is one of the best profs Ive had at SJSU, especially for 152. The class has a lot of doable labs, some fun HW, and a 2-person project which got difficult towards the end. He grades incredibly leniently on exams so you cant fail if you study the material. If you want to both learn and pass 152, take Professor Austin- you will not regret it!, Hes a very chill professor. Good majority of the class focuses on Haskell and while it is not my favorite language to work with, he gives many examples and is very approachable in office hours. One midterm and one final and there are no curve balls on the exam., Lots of labs, 1 for every class, 4 HWs, 1 project, 1 midterm and final, gives practice exam for both. Amazing lectures, worth it to go in person although attendance not mandatory. Learn lots of languages: Scheme, JS, Prolog, Ruby, ANTLR, Latex, Inform 7, Solidity, Rust. Grades leniently on exams, attempt everything. Overall, would recommend, Learned a LOT of programming langs. Responsive to students questions and always willing to help. Class is a lot of work: labs, HW, project, midterm, final. Grades leniently on exams. Talks fast so with the mask on, it was hard to understand him at times. Wish he knew more about Windows PC: had a major issue w/ the project, but he couldnt help me., Professor Austin is one of the the best professors at SJSU. I really enjoyed his class and learned so many different languages including Scheme, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, LaTex, and more! There are labs for every class but they are very doable. Definitely recommend for CS152!, Probably one of the best classes Ive taken at SJSU! He has gone over many languages during the semester and taught the material well. Despite the COVID status, hes been very helpful with office hours overall. Wish he thought other courses..., LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!!! HE IS HONESTLY ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS IVE HAD! I didnt know a thing about Haskell but after taking his course, I became quite confident in using it. His daily assignments kept me on track through-out the semester. The mid-term and final exam was a bit tough but its totally doable if you did your assignments., Friendly professor, good sense of humor and lecturer but dont be fooled this class is a lot of work. 2-3 labs per week, regular homeworks and a semester project ontop of exams. It can feel more like a 4 unit class at times. Try not to pair with other difficult CS classes if you dont want a stressful semester. Dont miss lectures!, This is a fast paced class with assignments being given on a regular basis. However, he will give you full credit for each lab as long as you show him that you tried. Learn Racket, JS, Prolog, Ruby, and a few other minor languages. All tests and homework are reasonable. Very approachable outside class and via email. Cant really say a bad word., Learned a lot of cool(and some not so cool) languages in this class. Austin is a great lecturer and definitely one of the best professors Ive had at SJSU., Learned Ruby, Scheme, Prolog, JavaScript. Great teacher, fair grader. No surprises on exams. Labs, homework and projects are simple but may take a lot of time. Very approachable., I learned so many programming languages taking this class. The professor is really smart and helpful. Scheme was the most challenges to for me. You will learn Ruby, Python, JS, C, Prolog, Rust, LaTex, and more. The course moved super fast. You need to catch up with the material. Dont miss a class!, Very nice and friendly professor. He gives you credit for every lab as long as you turn something in. He gives 50-75% for homework as long as you turn in something to show you tried. Very lenient on midterm and final, AND CURVES IT! And at the end of the semester curves the class. Hes extremely smart and great examples, but I didnt have time., Up to date with computer science field and shows an expansive knowledge of various languages. All readings are online supplements, helpful. Great lectures and will be more than happy to explain anything. Labs are useful and graded on participation, but will dictate how much you learn in the class. Fair exams. Strong knowledge of pop culture., Hes like a poster boy for effective modern teaching. Charismatic and respectful. Brisk lectures, good oration. Lecture material, textbook, homework and exams all complement each other nicely. Material was new and challenging, delivered at a good pace. Friendly, accessible in and after class and office hours. Good-humoured, hip to the latest memes., Great professor. You have labs to do, but as long as you try, he will give you a checkmark. Has a review day for all the material on the midterm. Make sure you study for the midterm. He is a lenient grader for the test because he gives you points for just answering the problems. If you do the homework, you should be fine. Didnt really use the book"
Rula Khayrallah,/professor/2208638,4.3,79%,3.5,"Lectures are clear! Exams are fair and relevant to lectures, allows cheatsheets. Exams arent cumulative. Weekly 1 question quizzes but are easy if you pay attention in class. Homework assignments are done in pairs. Highly recommend., Attend class and listen to her. Make sure you know how to do all the iClicker questions and attend the review session. There are no curveballs on the exams and youll only do poorly if you dont read the questions carefully., One of the kindest professors Ive had at SJSU. Super caring and is always willing to help. In class participation activities help to reinforce learning. Looking forward to having future classes with her! Thank you professor!, She has a motherly charm and truly cares about her students. Her lectures are amazing to me despite some comments saying theyre boring. iClicker ensures youre actively participating the class. She is knowledgeable and tries to answer questions as much as time permits. Exams arent crazy hard, but grading is strict considering you dont have IDE., Labs/Quizzes constantly done in class so you need to show up. Rula is a nice professor who is very knowledgeable about Python. Homeworks are mostly done in groups of 2 (can be done individually if you want). Posts helpful lecture notes on Canvas., A lot of material will be covered but very helpful slides and labs will be provided. Homeworks are graded pretty harshly (Has to be exactly how she wants it even if you have correct results. Rubric is provided). Exams are very fair. Try your best to keep up with material or else you are going to have a lot to catch up on once exams come around., If I had to describe Prof. Khayrallah\s class in one word, it\d be fair. She\s meticulous when giving feedback on assignments, accessible outside of class, and super friendly--gives off that mom vibe. The only thing I could complain about is how quick the pace is, but that\s more a symptom of the class content itself rather than her., She is a very hard professor. What she teaches in class is simple, but the homework and exam is extremely hard. I wont recommend you take it unless u want to be an AI expert. Seriously!, The material is great, but she made it boring. The way she presents the lecture is too formal, teachers are supposed to be a better alternative to a textbook or slides so you can understand in a simple way, it comes naturally to anyone who knows exactly what theyre talking about. Unless you like that type of class, I suggest someone else., Shes a fairly nice professor and wants you to succeed, but her exams can be pretty tough and theres a lot of material/concepts to remember. Definitely go to her office hours, start on the homeworks early, and study a lot., Take Rula for CS 152. Her slides are simple and concise. She lets you have 1 page cheat sheet for her midterms and final. For her exams, make sure you understand the material really well and that you can program in the languages you learned in this class. Answering exam questions can be tough if you dont understand her lectures or do great on HW., Very fantastic professor. Goes through the course material at a detailed and moderate pace. Homework assignments can be done in 1-2 days and textbook not always needed (she has slides tho). She does iclicker questions and weekly quizzes and take attendence so show up to class. Also, allows cheat sheet and only 1 midterm plus final for class., I took CS151 over the summer just to take her CS152 course (she teaches CS156 now). She is the best lecturer anywhere. Lectures use iClicker polls, assignments use boilerplates and have clear rubrics. 13 weekly questions, 3 lowest dropped. Midterm was medium difficulty, final was brutally tough. Allows 1 cheat sheet. Creates concise lecture slides., Rula is a great professor and she is very helpful. However, if you are planning to take her for CS 156 then I would advise you to not to.  She uses slides from Berkley and they are sadly not very helpful. Furthermore, this class is not as exciting as you might think. It is more like a math/stats class than a CS class."
Terry Allen,/professor/1540109,2.5,N/A,3.7,"Hes a really nice guy, but you get the feeling, hes just collecting a pay check and has no interest in teaching, either that or hes just disconnected from his students. The assignments are graded by a TA so expect no feed back. He doesnt give you enough time to complete them, and his exams are ridiculously long. Nice guy, shouldnt teach., Allen is a great individual, but you will not understand his lectures.Although I liked 1-on-1 meeting with him.When it comes to hws, they are tricky and he wants them to be turned in within 24 hours.In reality, for a C programmer it would take about a week to finish.He is a great person to talk to, but not recommended for teaching., Prof. Allen is a nice guy and does care about his students. However, his lectures were unhelpful. If you want to learn C you\re kind of on your own there. The assignments weren\t hard, but more just long and tedious and the due dates were only 2 days after the assignment was posted. The tests were hard, but he curves like crazy., Useless excuse for a professor. Gives unrealistically challenging assignments with only 48 hours to complete when many take a week or more. Gave absolutely NO feedback at all on homework or exams. Cant even turn his grades in by the final deadline., He is a very confused and unorganized person. It was a mission when it came to finding out what was due or when the exam was. There was absolutely no communication between him and the ta, which hurt the students more than anything., never returns graded work throughout the quarter and forgets to tell about assignments until the last week. Is a nice guy but has some real problems with organizing a class and responding to students, Professor Allen is a good man.  Takes ideas and decision of students into consideration.  Homework is really really tough.  Youll have a heck of a time trying to do them.  But youll learn a lot if you manage to do them.  Has a 1-on-1 with every student and he tells you about the real world of Computer Science.  Take him but take with caution :], Allen is a nice guy but the way he teaches the class can be somewhat frustrating. He lectures on random topics and is not always the best help when asking about the hw. He grades very generously but hell also give ridiculous tests and very time consuming hws. Take him but try to learn some C before taking him or you might get lost..., Decent teacher, very knowledgeable and knows his stuff. Very nice and always willing to help and answer questions. Class is hard but grades easy. Recommended., He is a great scholar or researcher, but not a good teacher. Its clear that he knows a lot about the computer architecture and C programming language, but its actually hard to get what he is talking about in class. He gives a very long test, and expect students to know a lot by their own. Not recommand to take the class., He rambles on. His tests are extremely long and he doesnt give you enough time. He gives you 2 days for homework which takes 2 weeks to do. Expects you to figure alot of stuff on your own. NOT RECOMMENDED., Hes extremely nice and really does care about his students. Hes always approachable for help if you dont understand the homework. Sometimes he goes off on tangents when he talks in class, but at least the tangents are still relevant to CS. Oh and he curves his midterms which are not so much difficult, but really really long."
Mira Jane,/professor/3040115,1.1,0%,4.8,"Terrible instructor, he does not even deserve the professor title. I dont understand how SJSU would hire someone this bad to teach. His lectures are confusing and he does not explain clearly. His exams are very hard and homework takes forever to finish, he thinks this is the only class students are taking. Please do students a favor and fire him., This professor has completely unrealistic standards for an introductory class. The lectures are useless because the exams and assignments are fully unrelated and much harder. Grading criteria is very unclear, and professor never gives clear answers to student questions. Overall, the class is confusing, poorly designed, and not worth the stress., Absolute dumpster fire of a class. Hes clearly knowledgeable, but is incapable of actually conveying any information. Avoid this professor at all costs, his class is an utter waste of time. Average on midterm was 8/40 with no curve; professor acknowledged that we didnt cover some of the topics in class and didnt seem to care., The lectures are boring & completely worthless. They do not cover any material in homework or on exams, and any questions are redirected to students who will not know answers themselves, because he is completely incapable of teaching. Youre on your own for homework. Its passable, but will be the absolute worst quality of education you ever have., I enrolled in Akash Nanavatis first class Fall 2024, he/she has since changed his/her name to Mira Jane. Was unable to teach students, 20% class average midterm. When we asked a question, we were told to ask our classmates. Taught grad level machine learning to undergrad students. No correlation between homework, lectures, and exams. SAVE YOURSELF, There is no way any student can pass this class. If you choose this Professor you are getting automatically a F. Lecture is very hard to understand. HW is no way near introduction to ML., If you are not a PHD graduate you are not passing the class. This is high level intensity of Machine learning topics that no seriously cant learn. The test is very difficult and as I would say impossible for master students. 96% of the class is failing. You being in the 4% percent, you wouldnt even need to go to SJSU. Just go to havard, DONT TAKE. Tests are a complete jokenothing like what you do in class. Theres no clear course outline, topics are covered too fast, and good luck getting your questions answered. The slides are utterly useless. The teaching is abysmal; its all just code lifted straight from the textbook, with barely any explanation. Save yourself the headache., The tests cover material not discussed in lectures, making them absurdly difficult and irrelevant. Professor is out of touch with what students should actually know. Instructions are vague at best, and forget about getting any useful help outside of class. Take this class only if youre ready to fail and retake it again the next semester."
Mariia Surmenok,/professor/2590561,5.0,100%,2.1,"Best Mommy Professor!\nClass was easy (at least, for a guy like me who knows Java). Made memes, had fun, and even had class discord. Has extra credit assignments, and has final team project. My team sucked and I had to do almost everything by myself, but I would gladly do it for her again. Its sad she left. I hope she found her wanted career, Take the class with a group of friends and enjoy. The slides are the answers to everything., Amazing teacher. The best one Ive had at SJSU so far. Her lectures are clear and informative. She gives extra credit participation points through iClicker so attend lecture and pay attention. Her tests are straight forward and fairly easy if you study and go over lecture material. The final group project is fun., Awesome professor. She understands her students really well. Took her online class Spring 2021. 3 Homeworks, 1 kinda big group project, 14 quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged as her lectures are useful and she offers a lot of extra credit. Would definitely take her again if I could., Fantastic Professor. Willing to go out of her way to help you out with homework and makes sure you understand. Lectures are easy to understand and very accessible. Test and are open notes/book and and homework are relatively easy to do but does help you practice. Overall a very awesome professor and class that actually teaches me new things as well, Had her for 49J and 151. She teaches the material pretty well and uses IntelliJ in class. Theres iClicker participation in class for extra credit in midterm and final. All homework and deadlines are reasonable. Theres weekly quizzes based on lectures. Generous in grading. Shes chill, I like her sense of humor. Id take care again if I could., Professor Surmenok is great. Weekly quizzes straight from lecture (lowest 3 dropped), a few hw assignments, 1 midterm, 1 group project, and 1 final. She has iClicker questions during lecture for extra credit. She is definitely understanding when it comes to online teaching and is very easygoing. If you follow lecture, easy A. I enjoyed her class!, Class became online halfway due to Covid 19. Her teaching is clear and makes sure everyone understands the concepts. She uses iClicker. 11 quizzes, 2 midterms, 1 final all based on lectures, all doable and reasonable. Homework load is ok. She was flexible and caring during Covid 19 crisis. I liked her a lot. Please dont change."
Yongwhan Lim,/professor/2775656,3.3,58%,3.9,"I wouldnt recommend, The professor is no good. He is too formal and does not how to teach. Students sleep in his class lol, Worst professor ever! Do not take his class. He does not teach anything and blames his students. He literally tries to tear their mental health apart. I warn you!, Professor Lim is very knowledgeable and encourages students to ask questions in class. His class is more code-driven and less theory driven. He directs his time towards areas that students are particularly struggling to grasp. In particular, he spent a lot of time on DP algorithms, which helped me immensely during coding interviews., I got a little bit overwhelmed at the beginning of the class due to a lot of different topics of data structures and algorithms. (Not because of the professor, it is the class nature to be challenging.) However, I was able to follow Professor Lims guidance. He gave us a lot of feedback and help us to learn better. You will learn a lot from him!, Professor Lim has great knowledge about algorithms. If you ask a question about an algorithm, he will be able to answer the question quickly, with details. If you are going to take the class, it would be better if you are able to implement some algorithms. Get ready to learn! If you dont understand it, ask the professor!, Professor Lim is one of those professors who prioritize learning over grades, which lets students focus more on their problem solving and not worry about grades too much. The class is very helpful when it comes to interview preparation."
Ashok Banerjee,/professor/985819,4.3,N/A,2.5,"Fantastic Professor. Comes from Industry background and provides good exposure to what is relevant. Clear concepts and very approachable., Worst prof in CMPE 273 , Undergrad type assignments, goes out of country for 5 weeks in between the sem, exams meaningless , childish professor, typical indian mentality! Avoid him totally! Simon shim and Sithu Aung are 1000% better than him., The Professor has profound knowledge in the field of Enterprise software. I would suggest you to start your EST specialization under him., Great professor with profound industrial knowledge and class participation really matters., Excellent Professor who comes with industrial background! He makes sure basic concepts are cleared and is always open to questions. Throws a lot of questions to class and is very helpful. Hands down, the best class for distributed systems., Very strong industry background and able to understand and explain at every level of the Software Stack. Right from OS, Networking to JVM, Web 2.0 and EJB, JMS, XA. Utilizes reinforcements in learning by throwing questions to the class during and after class. Encourages class participation"
Quang Duy Tran,/professor/2971637,3.0,50%,3.7,"Took this course a few semesters back but it wasnt difficult, watch the lectures + follow the slides and the assignments should be easy. The professor was really quick + responsive to emails, so if you ever need help on an assignment or have questions hell help you., I recommend taking this class with literally any other professor. Grading criteria is very vague and unclear. Youll be deducted points on his assignment, midterms, and final for requirements thatre never mentioned in the description. He gives 2 midterms and a final which are each worth 25% of the grade. He is also very slow at grading everything., Duy overall is a nice guy. Being that hes a grad student, hes busy. So expect slow replies to emails and slow grading. There are only a few projects that determine your grade, and his grading criteria is extremely particular but unspecific. There are several requirements that you can be deducted on that he wont tell you about UNLESS YOU ASK., Emphasizes the mistakes to not make often so you will do well as long as you pay attention to them. He is lenient on extending deadlines. His slides also have example codes that you can use. Can take a while to get things graded since hes a grad student. He also records his lectures and posts them. Exams were take home and can take some thinking., Student teacher so hes pretty chill. Willing to give out extensions on assignments if needed. Assignments are easy if you pay attention to his lectures since he literally tells you what to expect. Assignment descriptions were made vague to deter students from using AI, but it did make it confusing and people still used chatGPT and stuff so, Inconsistent grading with no clear rubric or homework/project requirement. Dismissive of students concerns and recommendations. Tardy with grading, had to wait on average up to 2-3 weeks for homework to be graded. For the finals, I did not even get to see my score and just received a final grade. Worst class I have taken in the CS dept."
Saroj Sabherwal,/professor/2056535,1.7,0%,2.8,"Doesnt make her own lecture materials.  Had us write summaries of chapters out of the book instead of covering the material herself.  Every test was take home, including final exam.  Homework assignments had way too many problems, but were simple.  You can safely skip every lecture if you can read the books.  Avoid., 5 HW 3 exam 1 final 1 group project all worth 10%. All are TAKE HOME and formatted same (3-4 Qs). Laid back and doesnt really care about teaching. Goes through some slides and writes on board but mainly self-taught. Use other resources to really learn. Take if you want a guaranteed A or B but if you want to really learn take someone else., Literally reads the slides word for word as a way to go over chapters. Does not emphasize on bullet points and as a result, her lectures skim through chapters. The homework was an insult to a juniors/senior level CS students intelligence. This class has really put the BS in BSCS., Take-home exams. Pushes back due dates twice. 11:59 due time means submit before, not at.   Get ready to read, indeed. So far, I am having to be my own professor - she has taught literally nothing. She is incredibly repetitive and vague. Nine group projects - same topic. Asked the same question 8 times (which should be learned from the class!), Very lazy teacher. She kind of rambles and reads directly from her power point slides and asks the class a lot of vague and ambiguous questions. Every single homework and test she has assigned has been collected at a date later than she assigned. Tests are take home. Everything I learned in this class Ive read from the book."
Devangi Chinchankar,/professor/2723102,4.0,100%,3.8,"Shes a software engineer at Facebook now! Shes great!, I took her for the first class of CS in SJSU. There are 3 tests in this class: 2 midterms and 1 final. Do all of your homework and participation exercises then you will be fine in 2 midterms. However, the final will be a little bit more difficult than the other tests. And the next thing is ready to read the textbook she assign before every lecture., A professor that inspires me to become more involved in Computer Science, thank you Professor!, Professor Devanji responds to questions very quickly so you can always contact her about your concerns! There is 1 quiz and 1 homework assignment due every week. You also must attend her lectures since she uses iclicker for participation points and she goes over participation assignments that are also due the next day."
Neha Gupta,/professor/1921124,4.0,N/A,2.3,"Very good teacher, and she will give you a lot of help if you need it. We had four textbooks but I only really used one, and we didnt need it right away. Id recommend to wait until class starts to get them., She once held extra classes on Fri and Sat for students who failed the quiz to have a private tutoring with her. In the beginning, she wouldnt make a lot of sense because Chapter 1 had many theories, its not her fault. But, once you get to Datapath and above, everything started to make sense and suddenly you would realize that shes very smart!, Neha is a great professor, she knows the materials very well. However, English is not her first language, so sometimes its difficult for her to explain some concepts or answer questions. There are a lot of materials covered in this class, so attending her lecture is very important. Besides, she gives 5% for participation and an A is 85% or above"
Charles Bocage,/professor/2189191,1.0,0%,5,"One of the worst professors SJSU can offer. Makes students seem student everytime you ask a question so no one wants to ask anything unless they liked getting called out in class. Not only that, but we didn\t even have class unless you had questions about youtube videos he posts in 240p and in 6 font so you can\t even see what he is saying. AVOID, Not recommended because you wont learn anything. He didnt care to teach anything whole semester. Very harsh grading., You wont learn anything. Take any other teacher but not him. All the lectures were recorded and posted on youtube. Class time was only for asking any question so entire semester was a joke. He gives zeros if you mess up on a single little thing. 8 Programming assignments, 1 midterm, 1 Project, 2 Homeworks, 1 Final. All the material is from Patra."
Quang Tran,/professor/2944621,5.0,100%,2.7,"Very straightforward course outline as the HW assignments build on each other and the concepts are combined on midterms and finals. Professor is great at explaining new technologies that are introduced in this class (PHP, Javascript, MySQL). He is generous and understanding with deadlines for HW and Midterms/Finals (everything is take home)., I enjoyed Professor Quang Trans class. Slows down and explains the hard things, goes over all the exam questions in depth before each exam. He was a great teacher and wanted to see students succeed. He was always willing to help and offer a lot of extra credit, but it was for a good reason. If you participate and try to learn, you will do fine., It was doable when taking this course with professor Tran as his lectures and materials were straightforward and concise. He was inspiring and easily approachable outside class whenever I sent email to ask questions. You need to pay attention during lectures for his exams, to be honest. Will definitely take him again for other courses., Currently taking his 174 course right now. The content is pretty lecture-heavy and theres an assignment every few weeks based on lecture content. Grading criteria are a little unclear at first but hes really approachable so ask a lot of questions if you need to."
Juan Gomez,/professor/2264107,3.0,50%,4.5,"Great professor. Should practice well to do well in tests., His classes are very time consuming. We need to give at-least 7 to 10 hours of studying per week. You can pass his classes but it is very stressful and heavy workload of assignments. Upside is you will end up studying a lot and gaining good knowledge but comes at a heavy cost. If you are taking then make sure you are ready to put in a many hours."
Ritik  Mehta,/professor/2928770,3.5,50%,3.5,"Good Professor. First time teaching so have to give him some leeway. Exams are all from the slides. Usually quick in responing to emails., The professor is still new because it is his first year teaching so it cannot be perfect like another professor I can understand. But just to be more clear on exam review instead of reading all slides from the class, only 5% material will be covered in the exam such a waste of time for students. Do more live coding than reading the slides"
Daniel Quintana,/professor/2996532,5.0,100%,3,I wasnt sure what to expect since Daniel does did not have any reviews prior to taking his course but I can by far say he is one of the best professors I have taken at SJSU. He is very interactive in class and allows you to actually try the things he is teaching through the hands ons. He super approachable and treats his students like real people.
